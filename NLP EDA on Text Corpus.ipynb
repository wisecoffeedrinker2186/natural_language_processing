Then Brutus, I haue much mistook your passion,\\nBy meanes whereof, this Brest of mine hath buried\\nThoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations.\\nTell me good Brutus, Can you see your face?\\n  Brutus. No Cassius:\\nFor the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection,\\nBy some other things\\n\\n   Cassius. 'Tis iust,\\nAnd it is very much lamented Brutus,\\nThat you haue no such Mirrors, as will turne\\nYour hidden worthinesse into your eye,\\nThat you might see your shadow:\\nI haue heard,\\nWhere many of the best respect in Rome,\\n(Except immortall Caesar) speaking of Brutus,\\nAnd groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake,\\nHaue wish'd, that Noble Brutus had his eyes\\n\\n   Bru. Into what dangers, would you\\nLeade me Cassius?\\nThat you would haue me seeke into my selfe,\\nFor that which is not in me?\\n  Cas. Therefore good Brutus, be prepar'd to heare:\\nAnd since you know, you cannot see your selfe\\nSo well as by Reflection; I your Glasse,\\nWill modestly discouer to your selfe\\nThat of your selfe, which you yet know not of.\\nAnd be not iealous on me, gentle Brutus:\\nWere I a common Laughter, or did vse\\nTo stale with ordinary Oathes my loue\\nTo euery new Protester: if you know,\\nThat I do fawne on men, and hugge them hard,\\nAnd after scandall them: Or if you know,\\nThat I professe my selfe in Banquetting\\nTo all the Rout, then hold me dangerous.\\n\\nFlourish, and Shout.\\n\\n  Bru. What meanes this Showting?\\nI do feare, the People choose Caesar\\nFor their King\\n\\n   Cassi. I, do you feare it?\\nThen must I thinke you would not haue it so\\n\\n   Bru. I would not Cassius, yet I loue him well:\\nBut wherefore do you hold me heere so long?\\nWhat is it, that you would impart to me?\\nIf it be ought toward the generall good,\\nSet Honor in one eye, and Death i'th other,\\nAnd I will looke on both indifferently:\\nFor let the Gods so speed mee, as I loue\\nThe name of Honor, more then I feare death\\n\\n   Cassi. I know that vertue to be in you Brutus,\\nAs well as I do know your outward fauour.\\nWell, Honor is the subiect of my Story:\\nI cannot tell, what you and other men\\nThinke of this life: But for my single selfe,\\nI had as liefe not be, as liue to be\\nIn awe of such a Thing, as I my selfe.\\nI was borne free as Caesar, so were you,\\nWe both haue fed as well, and we can both\\nEndure the Winters cold, as well as hee.\\nFor once, vpon a Rawe and Gustie day,\\nThe troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores,\\nCaesar saide to me, Dar'st thou Cassius now\\nLeape in with me into this angry Flood,\\nAnd swim to yonder Point? Vpon the word,\\nAccoutred as I was, I plunged in,\\nAnd bad him follow: so indeed he did.\\nThe Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it\\nWith lusty Sinewes, throwing it aside,\\nAnd stemming it with hearts of Controuersie.\\nBut ere we could arriue the Point propos'd,\\nCaesar cride, Helpe me Cassius, or I sinke.\\nI (as Aeneas, our great Ancestor,\\nDid from the Flames of Troy, vpon his shoulder\\nThe old Anchyses beare) so, from the waues of Tyber\\nDid I the tyred Caesar: And this Man,\\nIs now become a God, and Cassius is\\nA wretched Creature, and must bend his body,\\nIf Caesar carelesly but nod on him.\\nHe had a Feauer when he was in Spaine,\\nAnd when the Fit was on him, I did marke\\nHow he did shake: Tis true, this God did shake,\\nHis Coward lippes did from their colour flye,\\nAnd that same Eye, whose bend doth awe the World,\\nDid loose his Lustre: I did heare him grone:\\nI, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans\\nMarke him, and write his Speeches in their Bookes,\\nAlas, it cried, Giue me some drinke Titinius,\\nAs a sicke Girle: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me,\\nA man of such a feeble temper should\\nSo get the start of the Maiesticke world,\\nAnd beare the Palme alone.\\n\\nShout. Flourish.\\n\\n  Bru. Another generall shout?\\nI do beleeue, that these applauses are\\nFor some new Honors, that are heap'd on Caesar\\n\\n   Cassi. Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world\\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\\nWalke vnder his huge legges, and peepe about\\nTo finde our selues dishonourable Graues.\\nMen at sometime, are Masters of their Fates.\\nThe fault (deere Brutus) is not in our Starres,\\nBut in our Selues, that we are vnderlings.\\nBrutus and Caesar: What should be in that Caesar?\\nWhy should that name be sounded more then yours\\nWrite them together: Yours, is as faire a Name:\\nSound them, it doth become the mouth aswell:\\nWeigh them, it is as heauy: Coniure with 'em,\\nBrutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar.\\nNow in the names of all the Gods at once,\\nVpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede,\\nThat he is growne so great? Age, thou art sham'd.\\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods.\\nWhen went there by an Age, since the great Flood,\\nBut it was fam'd with more then with one man?\\nWhen could they say (till now) that talk'd of Rome,\\nThat her wide Walkes incompast but one man?\\nNow is it Rome indeed, and Roome enough\\nWhen there is in it but one onely man.\\nO! you and I, haue heard our Fathers say,\\nThere was a Brutus once, that would haue brook'd\\nTh' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome,\\nAs easily as a King\\n\\n   Bru. That you do loue me, I am nothing iealous:\\nWhat you would worke me too, I haue some ayme:\\nHow I haue thought of this, and of these times\\nI shall recount heereafter. For this present,\\nI would not so (with loue I might intreat you)\\nBe any further moou'd: What you haue said,\\nI will consider: what you haue to say\\nI will with patience heare, and finde a time\\nBoth meete to heare, and answer such high things.\\nTill then, my Noble Friend, chew vpon this:\\nBrutus had rather be a Villager,\\nThen to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome\\nVnder these hard Conditions, as this time\\nIs like to lay vpon vs\\n\\n   Cassi. I am glad that my weake words\\nHaue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus,\\nEnter Caesar and his Traine.\\n\\n  Bru. The Games are done,\\nAnd Caesar is returning\\n\\n   Cassi. As they passe by,\\nPlucke Caska by the Sleeue,\\nAnd he will (after his sowre fashion) tell you\\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note to day\\n\\n   Bru. I will do so: but looke you Cassius,\\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow,\\nAnd all the rest, looke like a chidden Traine;\\nCalphurnia's Cheeke is pale, and Cicero\\nLookes with such Ferret, and such fiery eyes\\nAs we haue seene him in the Capitoll\\nBeing crost in Conference, by some Senators\\n\\n   Cassi. Caska will tell vs what the matter is\\n\\n   Caes Antonio\\n\\n   Ant. Caesar\\n\\n   Caes Let me haue men about me, that are fat,\\nSleeke-headed men, and such as sleepe a-nights:\\nYond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke,\\nHe thinkes too much: such men are dangerous\\n\\n   Ant. Feare him not Caesar, he's not dangerous,\\nHe is a Noble Roman, and well giuen\\n\\n   Caes Would he were fatter; But I feare him not:\\nYet if my name were lyable to feare,\\nI do not know the man I should auoyd\\nSo soone as that spare Cassius. He reades much,\\nHe is a great Obseruer, and he lookes\\nQuite through the Deeds of men. He loues no Playes,\\nAs thou dost Antony: he heares no Musicke;\\nSeldome he smiles, and smiles in such a sort\\nAs if he mock'd himselfe, and scorn'd his spirit\\nThat could be mou'd to smile at any thing.\\nSuch men as he, be neuer at hearts ease,\\nWhiles they behold a greater then themselues,\\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous.\\nI rather tell thee what is to be fear'd,\\nThen what I feare: for alwayes I am Caesar.\\nCome on my right hand, for this eare is deafe,\\nAnd tell me truely, what thou think'st of him.\\n\\nSennit.\\n\\nExeunt. Caesar and his Traine.\\n\\n  Cask. You pul'd me by the cloake, would you speake\\nwith me?\\n  Bru. I Caska, tell vs what hath chanc'd to day\\nThat Caesar lookes so sad\\n\\n   Cask. Why you were with him, were you not?\\n  Bru. I should not then aske Caska what had chanc'd\\n\\n   Cask. Why there was a Crowne offer'd him; & being\\noffer'd him, he put it by with the backe of his hand thus,\\nand then the people fell a shouting\\n\\n   Bru. What was the second noyse for?\\n  Cask. Why for that too\\n\\n   Cassi. They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?\\n  Cask. Why for that too\\n\\n   Bru. Was the Crowne offer'd him thrice?\\n  Cask. I marry was't, and hee put it by thrice, euerie\\ntime gentler then other; and at euery putting by, mine\\nhonest Neighbors showted\\n\\n   Cassi. Who offer'd him the Crowne?\\n  Cask. Why Antony\\n\\n   Bru. Tell vs the manner of it, gentle Caska\\n\\n   Caska. I can as well bee hang'd as tell the manner of\\nit: It was meere Foolerie, I did not marke it. I sawe\\nMarke Antony offer him a Crowne, yet 'twas not a\\nCrowne neyther, 'twas one of these Coronets: and as I\\ntold you, hee put it by once: but for all that, to my thinking,\\nhe would faine haue had it. Then hee offered it to\\nhim againe: then hee put it by againe: but to my thinking,\\nhe was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then\\nhe offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by,\\nand still as hee refus'd it, the rabblement howted, and\\nclapp'd their chopt hands, and threw vppe their sweatie\\nNight-cappes, and vttered such a deale of stinking\\nbreath, because Caesar refus'd the Crowne, that it had\\n(almost) choaked Caesar: for hee swoonded, and fell\\ndowne at it: And for mine owne part, I durst not laugh,\\nfor feare of opening my Lippes, and receyuing the bad\\nAyre\\n\\n   Cassi. But soft I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?\\n  Cask. He fell downe in the Market-place, and foam'd\\nat mouth, and was speechlesse\\n\\n   Brut. 'Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse\\n\\n   Cassi. No, Caesar hath it not: but you, and I,\\nAnd honest Caska, we haue the Falling sicknesse\\n\\n   Cask. I know not what you meane by that, but I am\\nsure Caesar fell downe. If the tag-ragge people did not\\nclap him, and hisse him, according as he pleas'd, and displeas'd\\nthem, as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre,\\nI am no true man\\n\\n   Brut. What said he, when he came vnto himselfe?\\n  Cask. Marry, before he fell downe, when he perceiu'd\\nthe common Heard was glad he refus'd the Crowne, he\\npluckt me ope his Doublet, and offer'd them his Throat\\nto cut: and I had beene a man of any Occupation, if I\\nwould not haue taken him at a word, I would I might\\ngoe to Hell among the Rogues, and so hee fell. When\\nhe came to himselfe againe, hee said, If hee had done, or\\nsaid any thing amisse, he desir'd their Worships to thinke\\nit was his infirmitie. Three or foure Wenches where I\\nstood, cryed, Alasse good Soule, and forgaue him with\\nall their hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them;\\nif Caesar had stab'd their Mothers, they would haue done\\nno lesse\\n\\n   Brut. And after that, he came thus sad away\\n\\n   Cask. I\\n\\n   Cassi. Did Cicero say any thing?\\n  Cask. I, he spoke Greeke\\n\\n   Cassi. To what effect?\\n  Cask. Nay, and I tell you that, Ile ne're looke you\\ni'th' face againe. But those that vnderstood him, smil'd\\nat one another, and shooke their heads: but for mine\\nowne part, it was Greeke to me. I could tell you more\\nnewes too: Murrellus and Flauius, for pulling Scarffes\\noff Caesars Images, are put to silence. Fare you well.\\nThere was more Foolerie yet, if I could remember\\nit\\n\\n   Cassi. Will you suppe with me to Night, Caska?\\n  Cask. No, I am promis'd forth\\n\\n   Cassi. Will you Dine with me to morrow?\\n  Cask. I, if I be aliue, and your minde hold, and your\\nDinner worth the eating\\n\\n   Cassi. Good, I will expect you\\n\\n   Cask. Doe so: farewell both.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Brut. What a blunt fellow is this growne to be?\\nHe was quick Mettle, when he went to Schoole\\n\\n   Cassi. So is he now, in execution\\nOf any bold, or Noble Enterprize,\\nHow-euer he puts on this tardie forme:\\nThis Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit,\\nWhich giues men stomacke to disgest his words\\nWith better Appetite\\n\\n   Brut. And so it is:\\nFor this time I will leaue you:\\nTo morrow, if you please to speake with me,\\nI will come home to you: or if you will,\\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you\\n\\n   Cassi. I will doe so: till then, thinke of the World.\\nExit Brutus.\\n\\nWell Brutus, thou art Noble: yet I see,\\nThy Honorable Mettle may be wrought\\nFrom that it is dispos'd: therefore it is meet,\\nThat Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes:\\nFor who so firme, that cannot be seduc'd?\\nCaesar doth beare me hard, but he loues Brutus.\\nIf I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\\nHe should not humor me. I will this Night,\\nIn seuerall Hands, in at his Windowes throw,\\nAs if they came from seuerall Citizens,\\nWritings, all tending to the great opinion\\nThat Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely\\nCaesars Ambition shall be glanced at.\\nAnd after this, let Caesar seat him sure,\\nFor wee will shake him, or worse dayes endure.\\nEnter.\\n\\nThunder, and Lightning. Enter Caska, and Cicero.\\n\\n  Cic. Good euen, Caska: brought you Caesar home?\\nWhy are you breathlesse, and why stare you so?\\n  Cask. Are not you mou'd, when all the sway of Earth\\nShakes, like a thing vnfirme? O Cicero,\\nI haue seene Tempests, when the scolding Winds\\nHaue riu'd the knottie Oakes, and I haue seene\\nTh' ambitious Ocean swell, and rage, and foame,\\nTo be exalted with the threatning Clouds:\\nBut neuer till to Night, neuer till now,\\nDid I goe through a Tempest-dropping-fire.\\nEyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen,\\nOr else the World, too sawcie with the Gods,\\nIncenses them to send destruction\\n\\n   Cic. Why, saw you any thing more wonderfull?\\n  Cask. A common slaue, you know him well by sight,\\nHeld vp his left Hand, which did flame and burne\\nLike twentie Torches ioyn'd; and yet his Hand,\\nNot sensible of fire, remain'd vnscorch'd.\\nBesides, I ha' not since put vp my Sword,\\nAgainst the Capitoll I met a Lyon,\\nWho glaz'd vpon me, and went surly by,\\nWithout annoying me. And there were drawne\\nVpon a heape, a hundred gastly Women,\\nTransformed with their feare, who swore, they saw\\nMen, all in fire, walke vp and downe the streetes.\\nAnd yesterday, the Bird of Night did sit,\\nEuen at Noone-day, vpon the Market place,\\nHowting, and shreeking. When these Prodigies\\nDoe so conioyntly meet, let not men say,\\nThese are their Reasons, they are Naturall:\\nFor I beleeue, they are portentous things\\nVnto the Clymate, that they point vpon\\n\\n   Cic. Indeed, it is a strange disposed time:\\nBut men may construe things after their fashion,\\nCleane from the purpose of the things themselues.\\nComes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow?\\n  Cask. He doth: for he did bid Antonio\\nSend word to you, he would be there to morrow\\n\\n   Cic. Good-night then, Caska:\\nThis disturbed Skie is not to walke in\\n\\n   Cask. Farewell Cicero.\\n\\nExit Cicero.\\n\\nEnter Cassius.\\n\\n  Cassi. Who's there?\\n  Cask. A Romane\\n\\n   Cassi. Caska, by your Voyce\\n\\n   Cask. Your Eare is good.\\nCassius, what Night is this?\\n  Cassi. A very pleasing Night to honest men\\n\\n   Cask. Who euer knew the Heauens menace so?\\n  Cassi. Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of\\nfaults.\\nFor my part, I haue walk'd about the streets,\\nSubmitting me vnto the perillous Night;\\nAnd thus vnbraced, Caska, as you see,\\nHaue bar'd my Bosome to the Thunder-stone:\\nAnd when the crosse blew Lightning seem'd to open\\nThe Brest of Heauen, I did present my selfe\\nEuen in the ayme, and very flash of it\\n\\n   Cask. But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens?\\nIt is the part of men, to feare and tremble,\\nWhen the most mightie Gods, by tokens send\\nSuch dreadfull Heraulds, to astonish vs\\n\\n   Cassi. You are dull, Caska:\\nAnd those sparkes of Life, that should be in a Roman,\\nYou doe want, or else you vse not.\\nYou looke pale, and gaze, and put on feare,\\nAnd cast your selfe in wonder,\\nTo see the strange impatience of the Heauens:\\nBut if you would consider the true cause,\\nWhy all these Fires, why all these gliding Ghosts,\\nWhy Birds and Beasts, from qualitie and kinde,\\nWhy Old men, Fooles, and Children calculate,\\nWhy all these things change from their Ordinance,\\nTheir Natures, and pre-formed Faculties,\\nTo monstrous qualitie; why you shall finde,\\nThat Heauen hath infus'd them with these Spirits,\\nTo make them Instruments of feare, and warning,\\nVnto some monstrous State.\\nNow could I (Caska) name to thee a man,\\nMost like this dreadfull Night,\\nThat Thunders, Lightens, opens Graues, and roares,\\nAs doth the Lyon in the Capitoll:\\nA man no mightier then thy selfe, or me,\\nIn personall action; yet prodigious growne,\\nAnd fearefull, as these strange eruptions are\\n\\n   Cask. 'Tis Caesar that you meane:\\nIs it not, Cassius?\\n  Cassi. Let it be who it is: for Romans now\\nHaue Thewes, and Limbes, like to their Ancestors;\\nBut woe the while, our Fathers mindes are dead,\\nAnd we are gouern'd with our Mothers spirits,\\nOur yoake, and sufferance, shew vs Womanish\\n\\n   Cask. Indeed, they say, the Senators to morrow\\nMeane to establish Caesar as a King:\\nAnd he shall weare his Crowne by Sea, and Land,\\nIn euery place, saue here in Italy\\n\\n   Cassi. I know where I will weare this Dagger then;\\nCassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius:\\nTherein, yee Gods, you make the weake most strong;\\nTherein, yee Gods, you Tyrants doe defeat.\\nNor Stonie Tower, nor Walls of beaten Brasse,\\nNor ayre-lesse Dungeon, nor strong Linkes of Iron,\\nCan be retentiue to the strength of spirit:\\nBut Life being wearie of these worldly Barres,\\nNeuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe.\\nIf I know this, know all the World besides,\\nThat part of Tyrannie that I doe beare,\\nI can shake off at pleasure.\\n\\nThunder still.\\n\\n  Cask. So can I:\\nSo euery Bond-man in his owne hand beares\\nThe power to cancell his Captiuitie\\n\\n   Cassi. And why should Cæsar be a Tyrant then?\\nPoore man, I know he would not be a Wolfe,\\nBut that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe:\\nHe were no Lyon, were not Romans Hindes.\\nThose that with haste will make a mightie fire,\\nBegin it with weake Strawes. What trash is Rome?\\nWhat Rubbish, and what Offall? when it serues\\nFor the base matter, to illuminate\\nSo vile a thing as Caesar. But oh Griefe,\\nWhere hast thou led me? I (perhaps) speake this\\nBefore a willing Bond-man: then I know\\nMy answere must be made. But I am arm'd,\\nAnd dangers are to me indifferent\\n\\n   Cask. You speake to Caska, and to such a man,\\nThat is no flearing Tell-tale. Hold, my Hand:\\nBe factious for redresse of all these Griefes,\\nAnd I will set this foot of mine as farre,\\nAs who goes farthest\\n\\n   Cassi. There's a Bargaine made.\\nNow know you, Caska, I haue mou'd already\\nSome certaine of the Noblest minded Romans\\nTo vnder-goe, with me, an Enterprize,\\nOf Honorable dangerous consequence;\\nAnd I doe know by this, they stay for me\\nIn Pompeyes Porch: for now this fearefull Night,\\nThere is no stirre, or walking in the streetes;\\nAnd the Complexion of the Element\\nIs Fauors, like the Worke we haue in hand,\\nMost bloodie, fierie, and most terrible.\\nEnter Cinna.\\n\\n  Caska. Stand close a while, for heere comes one in\\nhaste\\n\\n   Cassi. 'Tis Cinna, I doe know him by his Gate,\\nHe is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?\\n  Cinna. To finde out you: Who's that, Metellus\\nCymber?\\n  Cassi. No, it is Caska, one incorporate\\nTo our Attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?\\n  Cinna. I am glad on't.\\nWhat a fearefull Night is this?\\nThere's two or three of vs haue seene strange sights\\n\\n   Cassi. Am I not stay'd for? tell me\\n\\n   Cinna. Yes, you are. O Cassius,\\nIf you could but winne the Noble Brutus\\nTo our party-\\n  Cassi. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this Paper,\\nAnd looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre,\\nWhere Brutus may but finde it: and throw this\\nIn at his Window; set this vp with Waxe\\nVpon old Brutus Statue: all this done,\\nRepaire to Pompeyes Porch, where you shall finde vs.\\nIs Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\\n  Cinna. All, but Metellus Cymber, and hee's gone\\nTo seeke you at your house. Well, I will hie,\\nAnd so bestow these Papers as you bad me\\n\\n   Cassi. That done, repayre to Pompeyes Theater.\\n\\nExit Cinna.\\n\\nCome Caska, you and I will yet, ere day,\\nSee Brutus at his house: three parts of him\\nIs ours alreadie, and the man entire\\nVpon the next encounter, yeelds him ours\\n\\n   Cask. O, he sits high in all the Peoples hearts:\\nAnd that which would appeare Offence in vs,\\nHis Countenance, like richest Alchymie,\\nWill change to Vertue, and to Worthinesse\\n\\n   Cassi. Him, and his worth, and our great need of him,\\nYou haue right well conceited: let vs goe,\\nFor it is after Mid-night, and ere day,\\nWe will awake him, and be sure of him.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nActus Secundus.\\n\\nEnter Brutus in his Orchard.\\n\\n  Brut. What Lucius, hoe?\\nI cannot, by the progresse of the Starres,\\nGiue guesse how neere to day- Lucius, I say?\\nI would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly.\\nWhen Lucius, when? awake, I say: what Lucius?\\nEnter Lucius.\\n\\n  Luc. Call'd you, my Lord?\\n  Brut. Get me a Tapor in my Study, Lucius:\\nWhen it is lighted, come and call me here\\n\\n   Luc. I will, my Lord.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Brut. It must be by his death: and for my part,\\nI know no personall cause, to spurne at him,\\nBut for the generall. He would be crown'd:\\nHow that might change his nature, there's the question?\\nIt is the bright day, that brings forth the Adder,\\nAnd that craues warie walking: Crowne him that,\\nAnd then I graunt we put a Sting in him,\\nThat at his will he may doe danger with.\\nTh' abuse of Greatnesse, is, when it dis-ioynes\\nRemorse from Power: And to speake truth of Caesar,\\nI haue not knowne, when his Affections sway'd\\nMore then his Reason. But 'tis a common proofe,\\nThat Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder,\\nWhereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face:\\nBut when he once attaines the vpmost Round,\\nHe then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe,\\nLookes in the Clouds, scorning the base degrees\\nBy which he did ascend: so Caesar may;\\nThen least he may, preuent. And since the Quarrell\\nWill beare no colour, for the thing he is,\\nFashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,\\nWould runne to these, and these extremities:\\nAnd therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge,\\nWhich hatch'd, would as his kinde grow mischieuous;\\nAnd kill him in the shell.\\nEnter Lucius.\\n\\n  Luc. The Taper burneth in your Closet, Sir:\\nSearching the Window for a Flint, I found\\nThis Paper, thus seal'd vp, and I am sure\\nIt did not lye there when I went to Bed.\\n\\nGiues him the Letter.\\n\\n  Brut. Get you to Bed againe, it is not day:\\nIs not to morrow (Boy) the first of March?\\n  Luc. I know not, Sir\\n\\n   Brut. Looke in the Calender, and bring me word\\n\\n   Luc. I will, Sir.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Brut. The exhalations, whizzing in the ayre,\\nGiue so much light, that I may reade by them.\\n\\nOpens the Letter, and reades.\\n\\nBrutus thou sleep'st; awake, and see thy selfe:\\nShall Rome, &c. speake, strike, redresse.\\nBrutus, thou sleep'st: awake.\\nSuch instigations haue beene often dropt,\\nWhere I haue tooke them vp:\\nShall Rome, &c. Thus must I piece it out:\\nShall Rome stand vnder one mans awe? What Rome?\\nMy Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome\\nThe Tarquin driue, when he was call'd a King.\\nSpeake, strike, redresse. Am I entreated\\nTo speake, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\\nIf the redresse will follow, thou receiuest\\nThy full Petition at the hand of Brutus.\\nEnter Lucius.\\n\\n  Luc. Sir, March is wasted fifteene dayes.\\n\\nKnocke within.\\n\\n  Brut. 'Tis good. Go to the Gate, some body knocks:\\nSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,\\nI haue not slept.\\nBetweene the acting of a dreadfull thing,\\nAnd the first motion, all the Interim is\\nLike a Phantasma, or a hideous Dreame:\\nThe Genius, and the mortall Instruments\\nAre then in councell; and the state of a man,\\nLike to a little Kingdome, suffers then\\nThe nature of an Insurrection.\\nEnter Lucius.\\n\\n  Luc. Sir, 'tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore,\\nWho doth desire to see you\\n\\n   Brut. Is he alone?\\n  Luc. No, Sir, there are moe with him\\n\\n   Brut. Doe you know them?\\n  Luc. No, Sir, their Hats are pluckt about their Eares,\\nAnd halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes,\\nThat by no meanes I may discouer them,\\nBy any marke of fauour\\n\\n   Brut. Let 'em enter:\\nThey are the Faction. O Conspiracie,\\nSham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous Brow by Night,\\nWhen euills are most free? O then, by day\\nWhere wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough,\\nTo maske thy monstrous Visage? Seek none Conspiracie,\\nHide it in Smiles, and Affabilitie:\\nFor if thou path thy natiue semblance on,\\nNot Erebus it selfe were dimme enough,\\nTo hide thee from preuention.\\nEnter the Conspirators, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Cinna, Metellus,\\nand\\nTrebonius.\\n\\n  Cass. I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest:\\nGood morrow Brutus, doe we trouble you?\\n  Brut. I haue beene vp this howre, awake all Night:\\nKnow I these men, that come along with you?\\n  Cass. Yes, euery man of them; and no man here\\nBut honors you: and euery one doth wish,\\nYou had but that opinion of your selfe,\\nWhich euery Noble Roman beares of you.\\nThis is Trebonius\\n\\n   Brut. He is welcome hither\\n\\n   Cass. This, Decius Brutus\\n\\n   Brut. He is welcome too\\n\\n   Cass. This, Caska; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus\\nCymber\\n\\n   Brut. They are all welcome.\\nWhat watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues\\nBetwixt your Eyes, and Night?\\n  Cass. Shall I entreat a word?\\n\\nThey whisper.\\n\\n  Decius. Here lyes the East: doth not the Day breake\\nheere?\\n  Cask. No\\n\\n   Cin. O pardon, Sir, it doth; and yon grey Lines,\\nThat fret the Clouds, are Messengers of Day\\n\\n   Cask. You shall confesse, that you are both deceiu'd:\\nHeere, as I point my Sword, the Sunne arises,\\nWhich is a great way growing on the South,\\nWeighing the youthfull Season of the yeare.\\nSome two moneths hence, vp higher toward the North\\nHe first presents his fire, and the high East\\nStands as the Capitoll, directly heere\\n\\n   Bru. Giue me your hands all ouer, one by one\\n\\n   Cas. And let vs sweare our Resolution\\n\\n   Brut. No, not an Oath: if not the Face of men,\\nThe sufferance of our Soules, the times Abuse;\\nIf these be Motiues weake, breake off betimes,\\nAnd euery man hence, to his idle bed:\\nSo let high-sighted-Tyranny range on,\\nTill each man drop by Lottery. But if these\\n(As I am sure they do) beare fire enough\\nTo kindle Cowards, and to steele with valour\\nThe melting Spirits of women. Then Countrymen,\\nWhat neede we any spurre, but our owne cause\\nTo pricke vs to redresse? What other Bond,\\nThen secret Romans, that haue spoke the word,\\nAnd will not palter? And what other Oath,\\nThen Honesty to Honesty ingag'd,\\nThat this shall be, or we will fall for it.\\nSweare Priests and Cowards, and men Cautelous\\nOld feeble Carrions, and such suffering Soules\\nThat welcome wrongs: Vnto bad causes, sweare\\nSuch Creatures as men doubt; but do not staine\\nThe euen vertue of our Enterprize,\\nNor th' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits,\\nTo thinke, that or our Cause, or our Performance\\nDid neede an Oath. When euery drop of blood\\nThat euery Roman beares, and Nobly beares\\nIs guilty of a seuerall Bastardie,\\nIf he do breake the smallest Particle\\nOf any promise that hath past from him\\n\\n   Cas. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\\nI thinke he will stand very strong with vs\\n\\n   Cask. Let vs not leaue him out\\n\\n   Cyn. No, by no meanes\\n\\n   Metel. O let vs haue him, for his Siluer haires\\nWill purchase vs a good opinion:\\nAnd buy mens voyces, to commend our deeds:\\nIt shall be sayd, his iudgement rul'd our hands,\\nOur youths, and wildenesse, shall no whit appeare,\\nBut all be buried in his Grauity\\n\\n   Bru. O name him not; let vs not breake with him,\\nFor he will neuer follow any thing\\nThat other men begin\\n\\n   Cas. Then leaue him out\\n\\n   Cask. Indeed, he is not fit\\n\\n   Decius. Shall no man else be toucht, but onely Caesar?\\n  Cas. Decius well vrg'd: I thinke it is not meet,\\nMarke Antony, so well belou'd of Caesar,\\nShould out-liue Caesar, we shall finde of him\\nA shrew'd Contriuer. And you know, his meanes\\nIf he improue them, may well stretch so farre\\nAs to annoy vs all: which to preuent,\\nLet Antony and Caesar fall together\\n\\n   Bru. Our course will seeme too bloody, Caius Cassius,\\nTo cut the Head off, and then hacke the Limbes:\\nLike Wrath in death, and Enuy afterwards:\\nFor Antony, is but a Limbe of Caesar.\\nLet's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers Caius:\\nWe all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar,\\nAnd in the Spirit of men, there is no blood:\\nO that we then could come by Caesars Spirit,\\nAnd not dismember Caesar! But (alas)\\nCaesar must bleed for it. And gentle Friends,\\nLet's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully:\\nLet's carue him, as a Dish fit for the Gods,\\nNot hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds:\\nAnd let our Hearts, as subtle Masters do,\\nStirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage,\\nAnd after seeme to chide 'em. This shall make\\nOur purpose Necessary, and not Enuious.\\nWhich so appearing to the common eyes,\\nWe shall be call'd Purgers, not Murderers.\\nAnd for Marke Antony, thinke not of him:\\nFor he can do no more then Caesars Arme,\\nWhen Caesars head is off\\n\\n   Cas. Yet I feare him,\\nFor in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar\\n\\n   Bru. Alas, good Cassius, do not thinke of him:\\nIf he loue Caesar, all that he can do\\nIs to himselfe; take thought, and dye for Caesar,\\nAnd that were much he should: for he is giuen\\nTo sports, to wildenesse, and much company\\n\\n   Treb. There is no feare in him; let him not dye,\\nFor he will liue, and laugh at this heereafter.\\n\\nClocke strikes.\\n\\n  Bru. Peace, count the Clocke\\n\\n   Cas. The Clocke hath stricken three\\n\\n   Treb. 'Tis time to part\\n\\n   Cass. But it is doubtfull yet,\\nWhether Caesar will come forth to day, or no:\\nFor he is Superstitious growne of late,\\nQuite from the maine Opinion he held once,\\nOf Fantasie, of Dreames, and Ceremonies:\\nIt may be, these apparant Prodigies,\\nThe vnaccustom'd Terror of this night,\\nAnd the perswasion of his Augurers,\\nMay hold him from the Capitoll to day\\n\\n   Decius. Neuer feare that: If he be so resolu'd,\\nI can ore-sway him: For he loues to heare,\\nThat Vnicornes may be betray'd with Trees,\\nAnd Beares with Glasses, Elephants with Holes,\\nLyons with Toyles, and men with Flatterers.\\nBut, when I tell him, he hates Flatterers,\\nHe sayes, he does; being then most flattered.\\nLet me worke:\\nFor I can giue his humour the true bent;\\nAnd I will bring him to the Capitoll\\n\\n   Cas. Nay, we will all of vs, be there to fetch him\\n\\n   Bru. By the eight houre, is that the vttermost?\\n  Cin. Be that the vttermost, and faile not then\\n\\n   Met. Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard,\\nWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey;\\nI wonder none of you haue thought of him\\n\\n   Bru. Now good Metellus go along by him:\\nHe loues me well, and I haue giuen him Reasons,\\nSend him but hither, and Ile fashion him\\n\\n   Cas. The morning comes vpon's:\\nWee'l leaue you Brutus,\\nAnd Friends disperse your selues; but all remember\\nWhat you haue said, and shew your selues true Romans\\n\\n   Bru. Good Gentlemen, looke fresh and merrily,\\nLet not our lookes put on our purposes,\\nBut beare it as our Roman Actors do,\\nWith vntyr'd Spirits, and formall Constancie,\\nAnd so good morrow to you euery one.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nManet Brutus.\\n\\nBoy: Lucius: Fast asleepe? It is no matter,\\nEnioy the hony-heauy-Dew of Slumber:\\nThou hast no Figures, nor no Fantasies,\\nWhich busie care drawes, in the braines of men;\\nTherefore thou sleep'st so sound.\\nEnter Portia.\\n\\n  Por. Brutus, my Lord\\n\\n   Bru. Portia: What meane you? wherfore rise you now?\\nIt is not for your health, thus to commit\\nYour weake condition, to the raw cold morning\\n\\n   Por. Nor for yours neither. Y'haue vngently Brutus\\nStole from my bed: and yesternight at Supper\\nYou sodainly arose, and walk'd about,\\nMusing, and sighing, with your armes acrosse\\nAnd when I ask'd you what the matter was,\\nYou star'd vpon me, with vngentle lookes.\\nI vrg'd you further, then you scratch'd your head,\\nAnd too impatiently stampt with your foote:\\nYet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,\\nBut with an angry wafter of your hand\\nGaue signe for me to leaue you: So I did,\\nFearing to strengthen that impatience\\nWhich seem'd too much inkindled; and withall,\\nHoping it was but an effect of Humor,\\nWhich sometime hath his houre with euery man.\\nIt will not let you eate, nor talke, nor sleepe;\\nAnd could it worke so much vpon your shape,\\nAs it hath much preuayl'd on your Condition,\\nI should not know you Brutus. Deare my Lord,\\nMake me acquainted with your cause of greefe\\n\\n   Bru. I am not well in health, and that is all\\n\\n   Por. Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,\\nHe would embrace the meanes to come by it\\n\\n   Bru. Why so I do: good Portia go to bed\\n\\n   Por. Is Brutus sicke? And is it Physicall\\nTo walke vnbraced, and sucke vp the humours\\nOf the danke Morning? What, is Brutus sicke?\\nAnd will he steale out of his wholsome bed\\nTo dare the vile contagion of the Night?\\nAnd tempt the Rhewmy, and vnpurged Ayre,\\nTo adde vnto his sicknesse? No my Brutus,\\nYou haue some sicke Offence within your minde,\\nWhich by the Right and Vertue of my place\\nI ought to know of: And vpon my knees,\\nI charme you, by my once commended Beauty,\\nBy all your vowes of Loue, and that great Vow\\nWhich did incorporate and make vs one,\\nThat you vnfold to me, your selfe; your halfe\\nWhy you are heauy: and what men to night\\nHaue had resort to you: for heere haue beene\\nSome sixe or seuen, who did hide their faces\\nEuen from darknesse\\n\\n   Bru. Kneele not gentle Portia\\n\\n   Por. I should not neede, if you were gentle Brutus.\\nWithin the Bond of Marriage, tell me Brutus,\\nIs it excepted, I should know no Secrets\\nThat appertaine to you? Am I your Selfe,\\nBut as it were in sort, or limitation?\\nTo keepe with you at Meales, comfort your Bed,\\nAnd talke to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the Suburbs\\nOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,\\nPortia is Brutus Harlot, not his Wife\\n\\n   Bru. You are my true and honourable Wife,\\nAs deere to me, as are the ruddy droppes\\nThat visit my sad heart\\n\\n   Por. If this were true, then should I know this secret.\\nI graunt I am a Woman; but withall,\\nA Woman that Lord Brutus tooke to Wife:\\nI graunt I am a Woman; but withall,\\nA Woman well reputed: Cato's Daughter.\\nThinke you, I am no stronger then my Sex\\nBeing so Father'd, and so Husbanded?\\nTell me your Counsels, I will not disclose 'em:\\nI haue made strong proofe of my Constancie,\\nGiuing my selfe a voluntary wound\\nHeere, in the Thigh: Can I beare that with patience,\\nAnd not my Husbands Secrets?\\n  Bru. O ye Gods!\\nRender me worthy of this Noble Wife.\\n\\nKnocke.\\n\\nHarke, harke, one knockes: Portia go in a while,\\nAnd by and by thy bosome shall partake\\nThe secrets of my Heart.\\nAll my engagements, I will construe to thee,\\nAll the Charractery of my sad browes:\\nLeaue me with hast.\\n\\nExit Portia.\\n\\nEnter Lucius and Ligarius.\\n\\nLucius, who's that knockes\\n\\n   Luc. Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you\\n\\n   Bru. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.\\nBoy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?\\n  Cai. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue\\n\\n   Bru. O what a time haue you chose out braue Caius\\nTo weare a Kerchiefe? Would you were not sicke\\n\\n   Cai. I am not sicke, if Brutus haue in hand\\nAny exploit worthy the name of Honor\\n\\n   Bru. Such an exploit haue I in hand Ligarius,\\nHad you a healthfull eare to heare of it\\n\\n   Cai. By all the Gods that Romans bow before,\\nI heere discard my sicknesse. Soule of Rome,\\nBraue Sonne, deriu'd from Honourable Loines,\\nThou like an Exorcist, hast coniur'd vp\\nMy mortified Spirit. Now bid me runne,\\nAnd I will striue with things impossible,\\nYea get the better of them. What's to do?\\n  Bru. A peece of worke,\\nThat will make sicke men whole\\n\\n   Cai. But are not some whole, that we must make sicke?\\n  Bru. That must we also. What it is my Caius,\\nI shall vnfold to thee, as we are going,\\nTo whom it must be done\\n\\n   Cai. Set on your foote,\\nAnd with a heart new-fir'd, I follow you,\\nTo do I know not what: but it sufficeth\\nThat Brutus leads me on.\\n\\nThunder\\n\\n  Bru. Follow me then.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nThunder & Lightning\\n\\nEnter Iulius Caesar in his Night-gowne.\\n\\n  Caesar.

Caesar, I neuer stood on Ceremonies,\\nYet now they fright me: There is one within,\\nBesides the things that we haue heard and seene,\\nRecounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch.\\nA Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets,\\nAnd Graues haue yawn'd, and yeelded vp their dead;\\nFierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds\\nIn Rankes and Squadrons, and right forme of Warre\\nWhich drizel'd blood vpon the Capitoll:\\nThe noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre:\\nHorsses do neigh, and dying men did grone,\\nAnd Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets.\\nO Caesar, these things are beyond all vse,\\nAnd I do feare them\\n\\n   Caes What can be auoyded\\nWhose end is purpos'd by the mighty Gods?\\nYet Caesar shall go forth: for these Predictions\\nAre to the world in generall, as to Caesar\\n\\n   Calp.

If there bee\\nany in this Assembly, any deere Friend of Caesars, to him\\nI say, that Brutus loue to Caesar, was no lesse then his. If\\nthen, that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Caesar,\\nthis is my answer: Not that I lou'd Caesar lesse, but\\nthat I lou'd Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were liuing,\\nand dye all Slaues; then that Caesar were dead, to\\nliue all Free-men? As Caesar lou'd mee, I weepe for him;\\nas he was Fortunate, I reioyce at it; as he was Valiant, I\\nhonour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. There\\nis Teares, for his Loue: Ioy, for his Fortune: Honor, for\\nhis Valour: and Death, for his Ambition. Who is heere\\nso base, that would be a Bondman? If any, speak, for him\\nhaue I offended.

The Noble Brutus,\\nHath told you Caesar was Ambitious:\\nIf it were so, it was a greeuous Fault,\\nAnd greeuously hath Caesar answer'd it.\\nHeere, vnder leaue of Brutus, and the rest\\n(For Brutus is an Honourable man,\\nSo are they all; all Honourable men)\\nCome I to speake in Caesars Funerall.\\nHe was my Friend, faithfull, and iust to me;\\nBut Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious,\\nAnd Brutus is an Honourable man.\\nHe hath brought many Captiues home to Rome,\\nWhose Ransomes, did the generall Coffers fill:\\nDid this in Caesar seeme Ambitious?\\nWhen that the poore haue cry'de, Caesar hath wept:\\nAmbition should be made of sterner stuffe,\\nYet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious:\\nAnd Brutus is an Honourable man.\\nYou all did see, that on the Lupercall,\\nI thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne,\\nWhich he did thrice refuse. Was this Ambition?\\nYet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious:\\nAnd sure he is an Honourable man.\\nI speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke,\\nBut heere I am, to speake what I do know;\\nYou all did loue him once, not without cause,\\nWhat cause with-holds you then, to mourne for him?\\nO Iudgement! thou are fled to brutish Beasts,\\nAnd Men haue lost their Reason. Beare with me,\\nMy heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar,\\nAnd I must pawse, till it come backe to me\\n\\n   1 Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings\\n\\n   2 If thou consider rightly of the matter,\\nCaesar ha's had great wrong\\n\\n   3 Ha's hee Masters? I feare there will a worse come in his place\\n\\n   4. Mark'd ye his words? he would not take y Crown,\\nTherefore 'tis certaine, he was not Ambitious\\n\\n   1. If it be found so, some will deere abide it\\n\\n   2. Poore soule, his eyes are red as fire with weeping\\n\\n   3. There's not a Nobler man in Rome then Antony\\n\\n   4. Now marke him, he begins againe to speake\\n\\n   Ant. But yesterday, the word of Caesar might\\nHaue stood against the World: Now lies he there,\\nAnd none so poore to do him reuerence.\\nO Maisters! If I were dispos'd to stirre\\nYour hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage,\\nI should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong:\\nWho (you all know) are Honourable men.\\nI will not do them wrong: I rather choose\\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong my selfe and you,\\nThen I will wrong such Honourable men.\\nBut heere's a Parchment, with the Seale of Caesar,\\nI found it in his Closset, 'tis his Will:\\nLet but the Commons heare this Testament:\\n(Which pardon me) I do not meane to reade,\\nAnd they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds,\\nAnd dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood;\\nYea, begge a haire of him for Memory,\\nAnd dying, mention it within their Willes,\\nBequeathing it as a rich Legacie\\nVnto their issue\\n\\n   4 Wee'l heare the Will, reade it Marke Antony\\n\\n   All. The Will, the Will; we will heare Caesars Will\\n\\n   Ant. Haue patience gentle Friends, I must not read it.\\nIt is not meete you know how Caesar lou'd you:\\nYou are not Wood, you are not Stones, but men:\\nAnd being men, hearing the Will of Caesar,\\nIt will inflame you, it will make you mad:\\n'Tis good you know not that you are his Heires,\\nFor if you should, O what would come of it?\\n  4 Read the Will, wee'l heare it Antony:\\nYou shall reade vs the Will, Caesars Will\\n\\n   Ant. Will you be Patient? Will you stay a-while?\\nI haue o're-shot my selfe to tell you of it,\\nI feare I wrong the Honourable men,\\nWhose Daggers haue stabb'd Caesar: I do feare it\\n\\n   4 They were Traitors: Honourable men?\\n  All. The Will, the Testament\\n\\n   2 They were Villaines, Murderers: the Will, read the\\nWill\\n\\n   Ant. You will compell me then to read the Will:\\nThen make a Ring about the Corpes of Caesar,\\nAnd let me shew you him that made the Will:\\nShall I descend? And will you giue me leaue?\\n  All. Come downe\\n\\n   2 Descend\\n\\n   3 You shall haue leaue\\n\\n   4 A Ring, stand round\\n\\n   1 Stand from the Hearse, stand from the Body\\n\\n   2 Roome for Antony, most Noble Antony\\n\\n   Ant. Nay presse not so vpon me, stand farre off\\n\\n   All. Stand backe: roome, beare backe\\n\\n   Ant. If you haue teares, prepare to shed them now.\\nYou all do know this Mantle, I remember\\nThe first time euer Caesar put it on,\\n'Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent,\\nThat day he ouercame the Neruij.\\nLooke, in this place ran Cassius Dagger through:\\nSee what a rent the enuious Caska made:\\nThrough this, the wel-beloued Brutus stabb'd,\\nAnd as he pluck'd his cursed Steele away:\\nMarke how the blood of Caesar followed it,\\nAs rushing out of doores, to be resolu'd\\nIf Brutus so vnkindely knock'd, or no:\\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesars Angel.\\nIudge, O you Gods, how deerely Caesar lou'd him:\\nThis was the most vnkindest cut of all.\\nFor when the Noble Caesar saw him stab,\\nIngratitude, more strong then Traitors armes,\\nQuite vanquish'd him: then burst his Mighty heart,\\nAnd in his Mantle, muffling vp his face,\\nEuen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue\\n(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.\\nO what a fall was there, my Countrymen?\\nThen I, and you, and all of vs fell downe,\\nWhil'st bloody Treason flourish'd ouer vs.\\nO now you weepe, and I perceiue you feele\\nThe dint of pitty: These are gracious droppes.\\nKinde Soules, what weepe you, when you but behold\\nOur Caesars Vesture wounded? Looke you heere,\\nHeere is Himselfe, marr'd as you see with Traitors\\n\\n   1. O pitteous spectacle!\\n  2. O Noble Caesar!\\n  3. O wofull day!\\n  4. O Traitors, Villaines!\\n  1.

Peace there, heare the Noble Antony\\n\\n   2. Wee'l heare him, wee'l follow him, wee'l dy with\\nhim\\n\\n   Ant. Good Friends, sweet Friends, let me not stirre you vp\\nTo such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny:\\nThey that haue done this Deede, are honourable.\\nWhat priuate greefes they haue, alas I know not,\\nThat made them do it: They are Wise, and Honourable,\\nAnd will no doubt with Reasons answer you.\\nI come not (Friends) to steale away your hearts,\\nI am no Orator, as Brutus is:\\nBut (as you know me all) a plaine blunt man\\nThat loue my Friend, and that they know full well,\\nThat gaue me publike leaue to speake of him:\\nFor I haue neyther writ nor words, nor worth,\\nAction, nor Vtterance, nor the power of Speech,\\nTo stirre mens Blood. I onely speake right on:\\nI tell you that, which you your selues do know,\\nShew you sweet Caesars wounds, poor poor dum mouths\\nAnd bid them speake for me: But were I Brutus,\\nAnd Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\\nWould ruffle vp your Spirits, and put a Tongue\\nIn euery Wound of Caesar, that should moue\\nThe stones of Rome, to rise and Mutiny\\n\\n   All. Wee'l Mutiny\\n\\n   1 Wee'l burne the house of Brutus\\n\\n   3 Away then, come, seeke the Conspirators\\n\\n   Ant. Yet heare me Countrymen, yet heare me speake\\n  All. Peace hoe, heare Antony, most Noble Antony\\n\\n   Ant. Why Friends, you go to do you know not what:\\nWherein hath Caesar thus deseru'd your loues?\\nAlas you know not, I must tell you then:\\nYou haue forgot the Will I told you of\\n\\n   All. Most true, the Will, let's stay and heare the Wil\\n\\n   Ant.

Moreouer, he hath left you all his Walkes,\\nHis priuate Arbors, and new-planted Orchards,\\nOn this side Tyber, he hath left them you,\\nAnd to your heyres for euer: common pleasures\\nTo walke abroad, and recreate your selues.\\nHeere was a Caesar: when comes such another?\\n  1.Ple. Neuer, neuer: come, away, away:\\nWee'l burne his body in the holy place,\\nAnd with the Brands fire the Traitors houses.\\nTake vp the body\\n\\n   2.Ple. Go fetch fire\\n\\n   3.Ple.

Now let it worke: Mischeefe thou art a-foot,\\nTake thou what course thou wilt.\\nHow now Fellow?\\nEnter Seruant.\\n\\n  Ser. Sir, Octauius is already come to Rome\\n\\n   Ant. Where is hee?\\n  Ser. He and Lepidus are at Caesars house\\n\\n   Ant. And thither will I straight, to visit him:\\nHe comes vpon a wish. Fortune is merry,\\nAnd in this mood will giue vs any thing\\n\\n   Ser. I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius\\nAre rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome\\n\\n   Ant. Belike they had some notice of the people\\nHow I had moued them. Bring me to Octauius.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter Cinna the Poet, and after him the Plebeians.\\n\\n  Cinna. I dreamt to night, that I did feast with Caesar,\\nAnd things vnluckily charge my Fantasie:\\nI haue no will to wander foorth of doores,\\nYet something leads me foorth\\n\\n   1. What is your name?\\n  2. Whether are you going?\\n  3. Where do you dwell?\\n  4. Are you a married man, or a Batchellor?\\n  2. Answer euery man directly\\n\\n   1. I, and breefely\\n\\n   4. I, and wisely\\n\\n   3. I, and truly, you were best\\n\\n   Cin. What is my name? Whether am I going? Where\\ndo I dwell? Am I a married man, or a Batchellour? Then\\nto answer euery man, directly and breefely, wisely and\\ntruly: wisely I say, I am a Batchellor\\n\\n   2 That's as much as to say, they are fooles that marrie:\\nyou'l beare me a bang for that I feare: proceede directly\\n\\n   Cinna. Directly I am going to Caesars Funerall\\n\\n   1. As a Friend, or an Enemy?\\n  Cinna. As a friend\\n\\n   2. That matter is answered directly\\n\\n   4. For your dwelling: breefely\\n\\n   Cinna. Breefely, I dwell by the Capitoll\\n\\n   3. Your name sir, truly\\n\\n   Cinna. Truly, my name is Cinna\\n\\n   1. Teare him to peeces, hee's a Conspirator\\n\\n   Cinna. I am Cinna the Poet, I am Cinna the Poet\\n\\n   4. Teare him for his bad verses, teare him for his bad\\nVerses\\n\\n   Cin. I am not Cinna the Conspirator\\n\\n   4. It is no matter, his name's Cinna, plucke but his\\nname out of his heart, and turne him going\\n\\n   3. Teare him, tear him; Come Brands hoe, Firebrands:\\nto Brutus, to Cassius, burne all. Some to Decius House,\\nand some to Caska's; some to Ligarius: Away, go.\\n\\nExeunt. all the Plebeians.\\n\\n\\nActus Quartus.\\n\\nEnter Antony, Octauius, and Lepidus.\\n\\n  Ant. These many then shall die, their names are prickt\\n  Octa. Your Brother too must dye: consent you Lepidus?\\n  Lep. I do consent\\n\\n   Octa. Pricke him downe Antony\\n\\n   Lep. Vpon condition Publius shall not liue,\\nWho is your Sisters sonne, Marke Antony\\n\\n   Ant. He shall not liue; looke, with a spot I dam him.\\nBut Lepidus, go you to Caesars house:\\nFetch the Will hither, and we shall determine\\nHow to cut off some charge in Legacies\\n\\n   Lep. What? shall I finde you heere?\\n  Octa. Or heere, or at the Capitoll.\\n\\nExit Lepidus\\n\\n  Ant. This is a slight vnmeritable man,\\nMeet to be sent on Errands: is it fit\\nThe three-fold World diuided, he should stand\\nOne of the three to share it?\\n  Octa. So you thought him,\\nAnd tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye\\nIn our blacke Sentence and Proscription\\n\\n   Ant. Octauius, I haue seene more dayes then you,\\nAnd though we lay these Honours on this man,\\nTo ease our selues of diuers sland'rous loads,\\nHe shall but beare them, as the Asse beares Gold,\\nTo groane and swet vnder the Businesse,\\nEither led or driuen, as we point the way:\\nAnd hauing brought our Treasure, where we will,\\nThen take we downe his Load, and turne him off\\n(Like to the empty Asse) to shake his eares,\\nAnd graze in Commons\\n\\n   Octa. You may do your will:\\nBut hee's a tried, and valiant Souldier\\n\\n   Ant. So is my Horse Octauius, and for that\\nI do appoint him store of Prouender.\\nIt is a Creature that I teach to fight,\\nTo winde, to stop, to run directly on:\\nHis corporall Motion, gouern'd by my Spirit,\\nAnd in some taste, is Lepidus but so:\\nHe must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth:\\nA barren spirited Fellow; one that feeds\\nOn Obiects, Arts, and Imitations.\\nWhich out of vse, and stal'de by other men\\nBegin his fashion. Do not talke of him,\\nBut as a property: and now Octauius,\\nListen great things. Brutus and Cassius\\nAre leuying Powers; We must straight make head:\\nTherefore let our Alliance be combin'd,\\nOur best Friends made, our meanes stretcht,\\nAnd let vs presently go sit in Councell,\\nHow couert matters may be best disclos'd,\\nAnd open Perils surest answered\\n\\n   Octa. Let vs do so: for we are at the stake,\\nAnd bayed about with many Enemies,\\nAnd some that smile haue in their hearts I feare\\nMillions of Mischeefes.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nDrum. Enter Brutus, Lucillius, and the Army. Titinius and\\nPindarus meete\\nthem.\\n\\n  Bru. Stand ho\\n\\n   Lucil. Giue the word ho, and Stand\\n\\n   Bru. What now Lucillius, is Cassius neere?\\n  Lucil. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come\\nTo do you salutation from his Master\\n\\n   Bru. He greets me well. Your Master Pindarus\\nIn his owne change, or by ill Officers,\\nHath giuen me some worthy cause to wish\\nThings done, vndone: But if he be at hand\\nI shall be satisfied\\n\\n   Pin. I do not doubt\\nBut that my Noble Master will appeare\\nSuch as he is, full of regard, and Honour\\n\\n   Bru. He is not doubted. A word Lucillius\\nHow he receiu'd you: let me be resolu'd\\n\\n   Lucil. With courtesie, and with respect enough,\\nBut not with such familiar instances,\\nNor with such free and friendly Conference\\nAs he hath vs'd of old\\n\\n   Bru. Thou hast describ'd\\nA hot Friend, cooling: Euer note Lucillius,\\nWhen Loue begins to sicken and decay\\nIt vseth an enforced Ceremony.\\nThere are no trickes, in plaine and simple Faith:\\nBut hollow men, like Horses hot at hand,\\nMake gallant shew, and promise of their Mettle:\\n\\nLow March within.\\n\\nBut when they should endure the bloody Spurre,\\nThey fall their Crests, and like deceitfull Iades\\nSinke in the Triall. Comes his Army on?\\n  Lucil. They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter'd:\\nThe greater part, the Horse in generall\\nAre come with Cassius.\\nEnter Cassius and his Powers.\\n\\n  Bru. Hearke, he is arriu'd:\\nMarch gently on to meete him\\n\\n   Cassi. Stand ho\\n\\n   Bru. Stand ho, speake the word along.\\nStand.\\nStand.\\nStand\\n\\n   Cassi. Most Noble Brother, you haue done me wrong\\n\\n   Bru. Iudge me you Gods; wrong I mine Enemies?\\nAnd if not so, how should I wrong a Brother\\n\\n   Cassi. Brutus, this sober forme of yours, hides wrongs,\\nAnd when you do them-\\n  Brut. Cassius, be content,\\nSpeake your greefes softly, I do know you well.\\nBefore the eyes of both our Armies heere\\n(Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs)\\nLet vs not wrangle. Bid them moue away:\\nThen in my Tent Cassius enlarge your Greefes,\\nAnd I will giue you Audience\\n\\n   Cassi. Pindarus,\\nBid our Commanders leade their Charges off\\nA little from this ground\\n\\n   Bru. Lucillius, do you the like, and let no man\\nCome to our Tent, till we haue done our Conference.\\nLet Lucius and Titinius guard our doore.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nManet Brutus and Cassius.\\n\\n  Cassi. That you haue wrong'd me, doth appear in this:\\nYou haue condemn'd, and noted Lucius Pella\\nFor taking Bribes heere of the Sardians;\\nWherein my Letters, praying on his side,\\nBecause I knew the man was slighted off\\n\\n   Bru. You wrong'd your selfe to write in such a case\\n\\n   Cassi. In such a time as this, it is not meet\\nThat euery nice offence should beare his Comment\\n\\n   Bru. Let me tell you Cassius, you your selfe\\nAre much condemn'd to haue an itching Palme,\\nTo sell, and Mart your Offices for Gold\\nTo Vndeseruers\\n\\n   Cassi. I, an itching Palme?\\nYou know that you are Brutus that speakes this,\\nOr by the Gods, this speech were else your last\\n\\n   Bru. The name of Cassius Honors this corruption,\\nAnd Chasticement doth therefore hide his head\\n\\n   Cassi. Chasticement?\\n  Bru. Remember March, the Ides of March reme[m]ber:\\nDid not great Iulius bleede for Iustice sake?\\nWhat Villaine touch'd his body, that did stab,\\nAnd not for Iustice? What? Shall one of Vs,\\nThat strucke the Formost man of all this World,\\nBut for supporting Robbers: shall we now,\\nContaminate our fingers, with base Bribes?\\nAnd sell the mighty space of our large Honors\\nFor so much trash, as may be grasped thus?\\nI had rather be a Dogge, and bay the Moone,\\nThen such a Roman\\n\\n   Cassi. Brutus, baite not me,\\nIle not indure it: you forget your selfe\\nTo hedge me in. I am a Souldier, I,\\nOlder in practice, Abler then your selfe\\nTo make Conditions\\n\\n   Bru. Go too: you are not Cassius\\n\\n   Cassi. I am\\n\\n   Bru. I say, you are not\\n\\n   Cassi. Vrge me no more, I shall forget my selfe:\\nHaue minde vpon your health: Tempt me no farther\\n\\n   Bru. Away slight man\\n\\n   Cassi. Is't possible?\\n  Bru. Heare me, for I will speake.\\nMust I giue way, and roome to your rash Choller?\\nShall I be frighted, when a Madman stares?\\n  Cassi. O ye Gods, ye Gods, Must I endure all this?\\n  Bru. All this? I more: Fret till your proud hart break.\\nGo shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are,\\nAnd make your Bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?\\nMust I obserue you? Must I stand and crouch\\nVnder your Testie Humour? By the Gods,\\nYou shall digest the Venom of your Spleene\\nThough it do Split you. For, from this day forth,\\nIle vse you for my Mirth, yea for my Laughter\\nWhen you are Waspish\\n\\n   Cassi. Is it come to this?\\n  Bru. You say, you are a better Souldier:\\nLet it appeare so; make your vaunting true,\\nAnd it shall please me well. For mine owne part,\\nI shall be glad to learne of Noble men\\n\\n   Cass. You wrong me euery way:\\nYou wrong me Brutus:\\nI saide, an Elder Souldier, not a Better.\\nDid I say Better?\\n  Bru. If you did, I care not\\n\\n   Cass. When Caesar liu'd, he durst not thus haue mou'd me\\n\\n   Brut. Peace, peace, you durst not so haue tempted him\\n\\n   Cassi. I durst not\\n\\n   Bru. No\\n\\n   Cassi. What? durst not tempt him?\\n  Bru. For your life you durst not\\n\\n   Cassi. Do not presume too much vpon my Loue,\\nI may do that I shall be sorry for\\n\\n   Bru. You haue done that you should be sorry for.\\nThere is no terror Cassius in your threats:\\nFor I am Arm'd so strong in Honesty,\\nThat they passe by me, as the idle winde,\\nWhich I respect not. I did send to you\\nFor certaine summes of Gold, which you deny'd me,\\nFor I can raise no money by vile meanes:\\nBy Heauen, I had rather Coine my Heart,\\nAnd drop my blood for Drachmaes, then to wring\\nFrom the hard hands of Peazants, their vile trash\\nBy any indirection. I did send\\nTo you for Gold to pay my Legions,\\nWhich you deny'd me: was that done like Cassius?\\nShould I haue answer'd Caius Cassius so?\\nWhen Marcus Brutus growes so Couetous,\\nTo locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends,\\nBe ready Gods with all your Thunder-bolts,\\nDash him to peeces\\n\\n   Cassi. I deny'd you not\\n\\n   Bru. You did\\n\\n   Cassi. I did not. He was but a Foole\\nThat brought my answer back. Brutus hath riu'd my hart:\\nA Friend should beare his Friends infirmities;\\nBut Brutus makes mine greater then they are\\n\\n   Bru. I do not, till you practice them on me\\n\\n   Cassi. You loue me not\\n\\n   Bru. I do not like your faults\\n\\n   Cassi. A friendly eye could neuer see such faults\\n\\n   Bru. A Flatterers would not, though they do appeare\\nAs huge as high Olympus\\n\\n   Cassi. Come Antony, and yong Octauius come,\\nReuenge your selues alone on Cassius,\\nFor Cassius is a-weary of the World:\\nHated by one he loues, brau'd by his Brother,\\nCheck'd like a bondman, all his faults obseru'd,\\nSet in a Note-booke, learn'd, and con'd by roate\\nTo cast into my Teeth. O I could weepe\\nMy Spirit from mine eyes. There is my Dagger,\\nAnd heere my naked Breast: Within, a Heart\\nDeerer then Pluto's Mine, Richer then Gold:\\nIf that thou bee'st a Roman, take it foorth.\\nI that deny'd thee Gold, will giue my Heart:\\nStrike as thou did'st at Caesar: For I know,\\nWhen thou did'st hate him worst, y loued'st him better\\nThen euer thou loued'st Cassius\\n\\n   Bru. Sheath your Dagger:\\nBe angry when you will, it shall haue scope:\\nDo what you will, Dishonor, shall be Humour.\\nO Cassius, you are yoaked with a Lambe\\nThat carries Anger, as the Flint beares fire,\\nWho much inforced, shewes a hastie Sparke,\\nAnd straite is cold agen\\n\\n   Cassi. Hath Cassius liu'd\\nTo be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus,\\nWhen greefe and blood ill temper'd, vexeth him?\\n  Bru. When I spoke that, I was ill temper'd too\\n\\n   Cassi. Do you confesse so much? Giue me your hand\\n\\n   Bru. And my heart too\\n\\n   Cassi. O Brutus!\\n  Bru. What's the matter?\\n  Cassi. Haue not you loue enough to beare with me,\\nWhen that rash humour which my Mother gaue me\\nMakes me forgetfull\\n\\n   Bru. Yes Cassius, and from henceforth\\nWhen you are ouer-earnest with your Brutus,\\nHee'l thinke your Mother chides, and leaue you so.\\nEnter a Poet.\\n\\n  Poet. Let me go in to see the Generals,\\nThere is some grudge betweene 'em, 'tis not meete\\nThey be alone\\n\\n   Lucil. You shall not come to them\\n\\n   Poet. Nothing but death shall stay me\\n\\n   Cas. How now? What's the matter?\\n  Poet. For shame you Generals; what do you meane?\\nLoue, and be Friends, as two such men should bee,\\nFor I haue seene more yeeres I'me sure then yee\\n\\n   Cas. Ha, ha, how vildely doth this Cynicke rime?\\n  Bru. Get you hence sirra: Sawcy Fellow, hence\\n\\n   Cas. Beare with him Brutus, 'tis his fashion\\n\\n   Brut. Ile know his humor, when he knowes his time:\\nWhat should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles?\\nCompanion, hence\\n\\n   Cas. Away, away be gone.\\n\\nExit Poet\\n\\n  Bru. Lucillius and Titinius bid the Commanders\\nPrepare to lodge their Companies to night\\n\\n   Cas. And come your selues, & bring Messala with you\\nImmediately to vs\\n\\n   Bru. Lucius, a bowle of Wine\\n\\n   Cas. I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry\\n\\n   Bru. O Cassius, I am sicke of many greefes\\n\\n   Cas. Of your Philosophy you make no vse,\\nIf you giue place to accidentall euils\\n\\n   Bru. No man beares sorrow better. Portia is dead\\n\\n   Cas. Ha? Portia?\\n  Bru. She is dead\\n\\n   Cas. How scap'd I killing, when I crost you so?\\nO insupportable, and touching losse!\\nVpon what sicknesse?\\n  Bru. Impatient of my absence,\\nAnd greefe, that yong Octauius with Mark Antony\\nHaue made themselues so strong: For with her death\\nThat tydings came. With this she fell distract,\\nAnd (her Attendants absent) swallow'd fire\\n\\n   Cas. And dy'd so?\\n  Bru. Euen so\\n\\n   Cas. O ye immortall Gods!\\nEnter Boy with Wine, and Tapers.\\n\\n  Bru. Speak no more of her: Giue me a bowl of wine,\\nIn this I bury all vnkindnesse Cassius.\\n\\nDrinkes\\n\\n  Cas. My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge.\\nFill Lucius, till the Wine ore-swell the Cup:\\nI cannot drinke too much of Brutus loue.\\nEnter Titinius and Messala.\\n\\n  Brutus. Come in Titinius:\\nWelcome good Messala:\\nNow sit we close about this Taper heere,\\nAnd call in question our necessities\\n\\n   Cass. Portia, art thou gone?\\n  Bru. No more I pray you.\\nMessala, I haue heere receiued Letters,\\nThat yong Octauius, and Marke Antony\\nCome downe vpon vs with a mighty power,\\nBending their Expedition toward Philippi\\n\\n   Mess. My selfe haue Letters of the selfe-same Tenure\\n\\n   Bru. With what Addition\\n\\n   Mess. That by proscription, and billes of Outlarie,\\nOctauius, Antony, and Lepidus,\\nHaue put to death, an hundred Senators\\n\\n   Bru. Therein our Letters do not well agree:\\nMine speake of seuenty Senators, that dy'de\\nBy their proscriptions, Cicero being one\\n\\n   Cassi. Cicero one?\\n  Messa. Cicero is dead, and by that order of proscription\\nHad you your Letters from your wife, my Lord?\\n  Bru. No Messala\\n\\n   Messa. Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her?\\n  Bru. Nothing Messala\\n\\n   Messa. That me thinkes is strange\\n\\n   Bru. Why aske you?\\nHeare you ought of her, in yours?\\n  Messa. No my Lord\\n\\n   Bru. Now as you are a Roman tell me true\\n\\n   Messa. Then like a Roman, beare the truth I tell,\\nFor certaine she is dead, and by strange manner\\n\\n   Bru. Why farewell Portia: We must die Messala:\\nWith meditating that she must dye once,\\nI haue the patience to endure it now\\n\\n   Messa. Euen so great men, great losses shold indure\\n\\n   Cassi. I haue as much of this in Art as you,\\nBut yet my Nature could not beare it so\\n\\n   Bru. Well, to our worke aliue. What do you thinke\\nOf marching to Philippi presently\\n\\n   Cassi. I do not thinke it good\\n\\n   Bru. Your reason?\\n  Cassi. This it is:\\n'Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs,\\nSo shall he waste his meanes, weary his Souldiers,\\nDoing himselfe offence, whil'st we lying still,\\nAre full of rest, defence, and nimblenesse\\n\\n   Bru. Good reasons must of force giue place to better:\\nThe people 'twixt Philippi, and this ground\\nDo stand but in a forc'd affection:\\nFor they haue grug'd vs Contribution.\\nThe Enemy, marching along by them,\\nBy them shall make a fuller number vp,\\nCome on refresht, new added, and encourag'd:\\nFrom which aduantage shall we cut him off.\\nIf at Philippi we do face him there,\\nThese people at our backe\\n\\n   Cassi. Heare me good Brother\\n\\n   Bru. Vnder your pardon. You must note beside,\\nThat we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends:\\nOur Legions are brim full, our cause is ripe,\\nThe Enemy encreaseth euery day,\\nWe at the height, are readie to decline.\\nThere is a Tide in the affayres of men,\\nWhich taken at the Flood, leades on to Fortune:\\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life,\\nIs bound in Shallowes, and in Miseries.\\nOn such a full Sea are we now a-float,\\nAnd we must take the current when it serues,\\nOr loose our Ventures\\n\\n   Cassi. Then with your will go on: wee'l along\\nOur selues, and meet them at Philippi\\n\\n   Bru. The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke,\\nAnd Nature must obey Necessitie,\\nWhich we will niggard with a little rest:\\nThere is no more to say\\n\\n   Cassi. No more, good night,\\nEarly to morrow will we rise, and hence.\\nEnter Lucius.\\n\\n  Bru. Lucius my Gowne: farewell good Messala,\\nGood night Titinius: Noble, Noble Cassius,\\nGood night, and good repose\\n\\n   Cassi.

I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me\\n\\n   Bru. Beare with me good Boy, I am much forgetfull.\\nCanst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a-while,\\nAnd touch thy Instrument a straine or two\\n\\n   Luc. I my Lord, an't please you\\n\\n   Bru. It does my Boy:\\nI trouble thee too much, but thou art willing\\n\\n   Luc. It is my duty Sir\\n\\n   Brut. I should not vrge thy duty past thy might,\\nI know yong bloods looke for a time of rest\\n\\n   Luc. I haue slept my Lord already\\n\\n   Bru. It was well done, and thou shalt sleepe againe:\\nI will not hold thee long.

Heere it is I thinke.\\nEnter the Ghost of Caesar.\\n\\nHow ill this Taper burnes. Ha! Who comes heere?\\nI thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes\\nThat shapes this monstrous Apparition.\\nIt comes vpon me: Art thou any thing?\\nArt thou some God, some Angell, or some Diuell,\\nThat mak'st my blood cold, and my haire to stare?\\nSpeake to me, what thou art\\n\\n   Ghost. Thy euill Spirit Brutus?\\n  Bru. Why com'st thou?\\n  Ghost. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi\\n\\n   Brut. Well: then I shall see thee againe?\\n  Ghost. I, at Philippi\\n\\n   Brut. Why I will see thee at Philippi then:\\nNow I haue taken heart, thou vanishest.\\nIll Spirit, I would hold more talke with thee.\\nBoy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio, Sirs: Awake:\\nClaudio\\n\\n   Luc.

My Lord, I do not know that I did cry\\n\\n   Bru. Yes that thou did'st: Did'st thou see any thing?\\n  Luc. Nothing my Lord\\n\\n   Bru. Sleepe againe Lucius: Sirra Claudio, Fellow,\\nThou: Awake\\n\\n   Var. My Lord\\n\\n   Clau. My Lord\\n\\n   Bru. Why did you so cry out sirs, in your sleepe?\\n  Both. Did we my Lord?\\n  Bru.

Go, and commend me to my Brother Cassius:\\nBid him set on his Powres betimes before,\\nAnd we will follow\\n\\n   Both. It shall be done my Lord.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nActus Quintus.\\n\\nEnter Octauius, Antony, and their Army.\\n\\n  Octa. Now Antony, our hopes are answered,\\nYou said the Enemy would not come downe,\\nBut keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions:\\nIt proues not so: their battailes are at hand,\\nThey meane to warne vs at Philippi heere:\\nAnswering before we do demand of them\\n\\n   Ant. Tut I am in their bosomes, and I know\\nWherefore they do it: They could be content\\nTo visit other places, and come downe\\nWith fearefull brauery: thinking by this face\\nTo fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage;\\nBut 'tis not so.\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\n  Mes. Prepare you Generals,\\nThe Enemy comes on in gallant shew:\\nTheir bloody signe of Battell is hung out,\\nAnd something to be done immediately\\n\\n   Ant. Octauius, leade your Battaile softly on\\nVpon the left hand of the euen Field\\n\\n   Octa. Vpon the right hand I, keepe thou the left\\n\\n   Ant. Why do you crosse me in this exigent\\n\\n   Octa. I do not crosse you: but I will do so.\\n\\nMarch.\\n\\nDrum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, & their Army.\\n\\n  Bru. They stand, and would haue parley\\n\\n   Cassi. Stand fast Titinius, we must out and talke\\n\\n   Octa. Mark Antony, shall we giue signe of Battaile?\\n  Ant. No Caesar, we will answer on their Charge.\\nMake forth, the Generals would haue some words\\n\\n   Oct. Stirre not vntill the Signall\\n\\n   Bru. Words before blowes: is it so Countrymen?\\n  Octa. Not that we loue words better, as you do\\n\\n   Bru. Good words are better then bad strokes Octauius\\n\\n   An. In your bad strokes Brutus, you giue good words\\nWitnesse the hole you made in Caesars heart,\\nCrying long liue, Haile Caesar\\n\\n   Cassi. Antony,\\nThe posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne;\\nBut for your words, they rob the Hibla Bees,\\nAnd leaue them Hony-lesse\\n\\n   Ant. Not stinglesse too\\n\\n   Bru. O yes, and soundlesse too:\\nFor you haue stolne their buzzing Antony,\\nAnd very wisely threat before you sting\\n\\n   Ant. Villains: you did not so, when your vile daggers\\nHackt one another in the sides of Caesar:\\nYou shew'd your teethes like Apes,\\nAnd fawn'd like Hounds,\\nAnd bow'd like Bondmen, kissing Caesars feete;\\nWhil'st damned Caska, like a Curre, behinde\\nStrooke Caesar on the necke. O you Flatterers\\n\\n   Cassi. Flatterers? Now Brutus thanke your selfe,\\nThis tongue had not offended so to day.\\nIf Cassius might haue rul'd\\n\\n   Octa. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make vs swet,\\nThe proofe of it will turne to redder drops:\\nLooke, I draw a Sword against Conspirators,\\nWhen thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe?\\nNeuer till Caesars three and thirtie wounds\\nBe well aueng'd; or till another Caesar\\nHaue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors\\n\\n   Brut. Caesar, thou canst not dye by Traitors hands.\\nVnlesse thou bring'st them with thee\\n\\n   Octa. So I hope:\\nI was not borne to dye on Brutus Sword\\n\\n   Bru. O if thou wer't the Noblest of thy Straine,\\nYong-man, thou could'st not dye more honourable\\n\\n   Cassi. A peeuish School-boy, worthles of such Honor\\nIoyn'd with a Masker, and a Reueller\\n\\n   Ant. Old Cassius still\\n\\n   Octa. Come Antony: away:\\nDefiance Traitors, hurle we in your teeth.\\nIf you dare fight to day, come to the Field;\\nIf not, when you haue stomackes.\\n\\nExit Octauius, Antony, and Army\\n\\n  Cassi. Why now blow winde, swell Billow,\\nAnd swimme Barke:\\nThe Storme is vp, and all is on the hazard\\n\\n   Bru. Ho Lucillius, hearke, a word with you.\\n\\nLucillius and Messala stand forth.\\n\\n  Luc. My Lord\\n\\n   Cassi. Messala\\n\\n   Messa. What sayes my Generall?\\n  Cassi. Messala, this is my Birth-day: at this very day\\nWas Cassius borne. Giue me thy hand Messala:\\nBe thou my witnesse, that against my will\\n(As Pompey was) am I compell'd to set\\nVpon one Battell all our Liberties.\\nYou know, that I held Epicurus strong,\\nAnd his Opinion: Now I change my minde,\\nAnd partly credit things that do presage.\\nComming from Sardis, on our former Ensigne\\nTwo mighty Eagles fell, and there they pearch'd,\\nGorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands,\\nWho to Philippi heere consorted vs:\\nThis Morning are they fled away, and gone,\\nAnd in their steeds, do Rauens, Crowes, and Kites\\nFly ore our heads, and downward looke on vs\\nAs we were sickely prey; their shadowes seeme\\nA Canopy most fatall, vnder which\\nOur Army lies, ready to giue vp the Ghost\\n\\n   Messa. Beleeue not so\\n\\n   Cassi. I but beleeue it partly,\\nFor I am fresh of spirit, and resolu'd\\nTo meete all perils, very constantly\\n\\n   Bru. Euen so Lucillius\\n\\n   Cassi. Now most Noble Brutus,\\nThe Gods to day stand friendly, that we may\\nLouers in peace, leade on our dayes to age.\\nBut since the affayres of men rests still incertaine,\\nLet's reason with the worst that may befall.\\nIf we do lose this Battaile, then is this\\nThe very last time we shall speake together:\\nWhat are you then determined to do?\\n  Bru. Euen by the rule of that Philosophy,\\nBy which I did blame Cato, for the death\\nWhich he did giue himselfe, I know not how:\\nBut I do finde it Cowardly, and vile,\\nFor feare of what might fall, so to preuent\\nThe time of life, arming my selfe with patience,\\nTo stay the prouidence of some high Powers,\\nThat gouerne vs below\\n\\n   Cassi. Then, if we loose this Battaile,\\nYou are contented to be led in Triumph\\nThorow the streets of Rome\\n\\n   Bru. No Cassius, no:\\nThinke not thou Noble Romane,\\nThat euer Brutus will go bound to Rome,\\nHe beares too great a minde. But this same day\\nMust end that worke, the Ides of March begun.\\nAnd whether we shall meete againe, I know not:\\nTherefore our euerlasting farewell take:\\nFor euer, and for euer, farewell Cassius,\\nIf we do meete againe, why we shall smile;\\nIf not, why then this parting was well made\\n\\n   Cassi. For euer, and for euer, farewell Brutus:\\nIf we do meete againe, wee'l smile indeede;\\nIf not, 'tis true, this parting was well made\\n\\n   Bru. Why then leade on. O that a man might know\\nThe end of this dayes businesse, ere it come:\\nBut it sufficeth, that the day will end,\\nAnd then the end is knowne. Come ho, away.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nAlarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.\\n\\n  Bru. Ride, ride Messala, ride and giue these Billes\\nVnto the Legions, on the other side.\\n\\nLowd Alarum.\\n\\nLet them set on at once: for I perceiue\\nBut cold demeanor in Octauio's wing:\\nAnd sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow:\\nRide, ride Messala, let them all come downe.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nAlarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.\\n\\n  Cassi. O looke Titinius, looke, the Villaines flye:\\nMy selfe haue to mine owne turn'd Enemy:\\nThis Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe,\\nI slew the Coward, and did take it from him\\n\\n   Titin. O Cassius, Brutus gaue the word too early,\\nWho hauing some aduantage on Octauius,\\nTooke it too eagerly: his Soldiers fell to spoyle,\\nWhilst we by Antony are all inclos'd.\\nEnter Pindarus.\\n\\n  Pind. Fly further off my Lord: flye further off,\\nMark Antony is in your Tents my Lord:\\nFlye therefore Noble Cassius, flye farre off\\n\\n   Cassi. This Hill is farre enough. Looke, look Titinius\\nAre those my Tents where I perceiue the fire?\\n  Tit. They are, my Lord\\n\\n   Cassi. Titinius, if thou louest me,\\nMount thou my horse, and hide thy spurres in him,\\nTill he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes\\nAnd heere againe, that I may rest assur'd\\nWhether yond Troopes, are Friend or Enemy\\n\\n   Tit. I will be heere againe, euen with a thought.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  Cassi. Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill,\\nMy sight was euer thicke: regard Titinius,\\nAnd tell me what thou not'st about the Field.\\nThis day I breathed first, Time is come round,\\nAnd where I did begin, there shall I end,\\nMy life is run his compasse. Sirra, what newes?\\n  Pind. Aboue. O my Lord\\n\\n   Cassi. What newes?\\n  Pind. Titinius is enclosed round about\\nWith Horsemen, that make to him on the Spurre,\\nYet he spurres on. Now they are almost on him:\\nNow Titinius. Now some light: O he lights too.\\nHee's tane.\\n\\nShowt.\\n\\nAnd hearke, they shout for ioy\\n\\n   Cassi. Come downe, behold no more:\\nO Coward that I am, to liue so long,\\nTo see my best Friend tane before my face\\nEnter Pindarus.\\n\\nCome hither sirrah: In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner,\\nAnd then I swore thee, sauing of thy life,\\nThat whatsoeuer I did bid thee do,\\nThou should'st attempt it. Come now, keepe thine oath,\\nNow be a Free-man, and with this good Sword\\nThat ran through Caesars bowels, search this bosome.\\nStand not to answer: Heere, take thou the Hilts,\\nAnd when my face is couer'd, as 'tis now,\\nGuide thou the Sword- Caesar, thou art reueng'd,\\nEuen with the Sword that kill'd thee\\n\\n   Pin. So, I am free,\\nYet would not so haue beene\\nDurst I haue done my will. O Cassius,\\nFarre from this Country Pindarus shall run,\\nWhere neuer Roman shall take note of him.\\nEnter Titinius and Messala.\\n\\n  Messa. It is but change, Titinius: for Octauius\\nIs ouerthrowne by Noble Brutus power,\\nAs Cassius Legions are by Antony\\n\\n   Titin. These tydings will well comfort Cassius\\n\\n   Messa. Where did you leaue him\\n\\n   Titin. All disconsolate,\\nWith Pindarus his Bondman, on this Hill\\n\\n   Messa. Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground?\\n  Titin. He lies not like the Liuing. O my heart!\\n  Messa. Is not that hee?\\n  Titin. No, this was he Messala,\\nBut Cassius is no more. O setting Sunne:\\nAs in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night;\\nSo in his red blood Cassius day is set.\\nThe Sunne of Rome is set. Our day is gone,\\nClowds, Dewes, and Dangers come; our deeds are done:\\nMistrust of my successe hath done this deed\\n\\n   Messa. Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed.\\nO hatefull Error, Melancholies Childe:\\nWhy do'st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men\\nThe things that are not? O Error soone conceyu'd,\\nThou neuer com'st vnto a happy byrth,\\nBut kil'st the Mother that engendred thee\\n\\n   Tit. What Pindarus? Where art thou Pindarus?\\n  Messa. Seeke him Titinius, whilst I go to meet\\nThe Noble Brutus, thrusting this report\\nInto his eares; I may say thrusting it:\\nFor piercing Steele, and Darts inuenomed,\\nShall be as welcome to the eares of Brutus,\\nAs tydings of this sight\\n\\n   Tit. Hye you Messala,\\nAnd I will seeke for Pindarus the while:\\nWhy did'st thou send me forth braue Cassius?\\nDid I not meet thy Friends, and did not they\\nPut on my Browes this wreath of Victorie,\\nAnd bid me giue it thee? Did'st thou not heare their showts?\\nAlas, thou hast misconstrued euery thing.\\nBut hold thee, take this Garland on thy Brow,\\nThy Brutus bid me giue it thee, and I\\nWill do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,\\nAnd see how I regarded Caius Cassius:\\nBy your leaue Gods: This is a Romans part,\\nCome Cassius Sword, and finde Titinius hart.\\n\\nDies\\n\\nAlarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, yong Cato, Strato, Volumnius, and\\nLucillius.\\n\\n  Bru. Where, where Messala, doth his body lye?\\n  Messa. Loe yonder, and Titinius mourning it\\n\\n   Bru. Titinius face is vpward\\n\\n   Cato. He is slaine\\n\\n   Bru. O Iulius Caesar, thou art mighty yet,\\nThy Spirit walkes abroad, and turnes our Swords\\nIn our owne proper Entrailes. Low Alarums\\n\\n   Cato. Braue Titinius,\\nLooke where he haue not crown'd dead Cassius\\n\\n   Bru. Are yet two Romans liuing such as these?\\nThe last of all the Romans, far thee well:\\nIt is impossible, that euer Rome\\nShould breed thy fellow. Friends I owe mo teares\\nTo this dead man, then you shall see me pay.\\nI shall finde time, Cassius: I shall finde time.\\nCome therefore, and to Tharsus send his body,\\nHis Funerals shall not be in our Campe,\\nLeast it discomfort vs. Lucillius come,\\nAnd come yong Cato, let vs to the Field,\\nLabio and Flauio set our Battailes on:\\n'Tis three a clocke, and Romans yet ere night,\\nWe shall try Fortune in a second fight.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nAlarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, Cato, Lucillius, and Flauius.\\n\\n  Bru. Yet Country-men: O yet, hold vp your heads\\n\\n   Cato. What Bastard doth not? Who will go with me?\\nI will proclaime my name about the Field.\\nI am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe.\\nA Foe to Tyrants, and my Countries Friend.\\nI am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe.\\nEnter Souldiers, and fight.\\n\\nAnd I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I,\\nBrutus my Countries Friend: Know me for Brutus\\n\\n   Luc. O yong and Noble Cato, art thou downe?\\nWhy now thou dyest, as brauely as Titinius,\\nAnd may'st be honour'd, being Cato's Sonne\\n\\n   Sold. Yeeld, or thou dyest\\n\\n   Luc. Onely I yeeld to dye:\\nThere is so much, that thou wilt kill me straight:\\nKill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death\\n\\n   Sold. We must not: a Noble Prisoner.\\nEnter Antony.\\n\\n  2.Sold.

Safe Antony, Brutus is safe enough:\\nI dare assure thee, that no Enemy\\nShall euer take aliue the Noble Brutus:\\nThe Gods defend him from so great a shame,\\nWhen you do finde him, or aliue, or dead,\\nHe will be found like Brutus, like himselfe\\n\\n   Ant. This is not Brutus friend, but I assure you,\\nA prize no lesse in worth; keepe this man safe,\\nGiue him all kindnesse. I had rather haue\\nSuch men my Friends, then Enemies. Go on,\\nAnd see where Brutus be aliue or dead,\\nAnd bring vs word, vnto Octauius Tent:\\nHow euery thing is chanc'd.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nEnter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.\\n\\n  Brut. Come poore remaines of friends, rest on this\\nRocke\\n\\n   Clit. Statillius shew'd the Torch-light, but my Lord\\nHe came not backe: he is or tane, or slaine\\n\\n   Brut. Sit thee downe, Clitus: slaying is the word,\\nIt is a deed in fashion. Hearke thee, Clitus\\n\\n   Clit. What I, my Lord? No, not for all the World\\n\\n   Brut. Peace then, no words\\n\\n   Clit. Ile rather kill my selfe\\n\\n   Brut. Hearke thee, Dardanius\\n\\n   Dard. Shall I doe such a deed?\\n  Clit. O Dardanius\\n\\n   Dard. O Clitus\\n\\n   Clit. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?\\n  Dard. To kill him, Clitus: looke he meditates\\n\\n   Clit. Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe,\\nThat it runnes ouer euen at his eyes\\n\\n   Brut. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word\\n\\n   Volum. What sayes my Lord?\\n  Brut. Why this, Volumnius:\\nThe Ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me\\nTwo seuerall times by Night: at Sardis, once;\\nAnd this last Night, here in Philippi fields:\\nI know my houre is come\\n\\n   Volum. Not so, my Lord\\n\\n   Brut. Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.\\nThou seest the World, Volumnius, how it goes,\\nOur Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit:\\n\\nLow Alarums.\\n\\nIt is more worthy, to leape in our selues,\\nThen tarry till they push vs. Good Volumnius,\\nThou know'st, that we two went to Schoole together:\\nEuen for that our loue of old, I prethee\\nHold thou my Sword Hilts, whilest I runne on it\\n\\n   Vol. That's not an Office for a friend, my Lord.\\n\\nAlarum still.\\n\\n  Cly.

Farewell to you, and you, and Volumnius.\\nStrato, thou hast bin all this while asleepe:\\nFarewell to thee, to Strato, Countrymen:\\nMy heart doth ioy, that yet in all my life,\\nI found no man, but he was true to me.\\nI shall haue glory by this loosing day\\nMore then Octauius, and Marke Antony,\\nBy this vile Conquest shall attaine vnto.\\nSo fare you well at once, for Brutus tongue\\nHath almost ended his liues History:\\nNight hangs vpon mine eyes, my Bones would rest,\\nThat haue but labour'd, to attaine this houre.\\n\\nAlarum.

How dyed my Master Strato?\\n  Stra. I held the Sword, and he did run on it\\n\\n   Messa. Octauius, then take him to follow thee,\\nThat did the latest seruice to my Master\\n\\n   Ant.

       "'[Poems by William Blake 1789]\\n\\n \\nSONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE\\nand THE BOOK of THEL\\n\\n\\n SONGS OF INNOCENCE\\n \\n \\n INTRODUCTION\\n \\n Piping down the valleys wild,\\n   Piping songs of pleasant glee,\\n On a cloud I saw a child,\\n   And he laughing said to me:\\n \\n \"Pipe a song about a Lamb!\"\\n   So I piped with merry cheer.\\n \"Piper, pipe that song again;\"\\n   So I piped: he wept to hear.\\n \\n \"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;\\n   Sing thy songs of happy cheer:!\"\\n So I sang the same again,\\n   While he wept with joy to hear.\\n \\n \"Piper, sit thee down and write\\n   In a book, that all may read.\"\\n So he vanish\\'d from my sight;\\n   And I pluck\\'d a hollow reed,\\n \\n And I made a rural pen,\\n   And I stain\\'d the water clear,\\n And I wrote my happy songs\\n   Every child may joy to hear.\\n \\n \\n THE SHEPHERD\\n \\n How sweet is the Shepherd\\'s sweet lot!\\n From the morn to the evening he stays;\\n He shall follow his sheep all the day,\\n And his tongue shall be filled with praise.\\n \\n For he hears the lambs\\' innocent call,\\n And he hears the ewes\\' tender reply;\\n He is watching while they are in peace,\\n For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.\\n \\n \\n THE ECHOING GREEN\\n \\n The sun does arise,\\n And make happy the skies;\\n The merry bells ring\\n To welcome the Spring;\\n The skylark and thrush,\\n The birds of the bush,\\n Sing louder around\\n To the bells\\' cheerful sound;\\n While our sports shall be seen\\n On the echoing Green.\\n \\n Old John, with white hair,\\n Does laugh away care,\\n Sitting under the oak,\\n Among the old folk.\\n They laugh at our play,\\n And soon they all say,\\n \"Such, such were the joys\\n When we all -- girls and boys --\\n In our youth-time were seen\\n On the echoing Green.\"\\n \\n Till the little ones, weary,\\n No more can be merry:\\n The sun does descend,\\n And our sports have an end.\\n Round the laps of their mothers\\n Many sisters and brothers,\\n Like birds in their nest,\\n Are ready for rest,\\n And sport no more seen\\n On the darkening green.\\n \\n \\n THE LAMB\\n \\n   Little Lamb, who make thee\\n   Dost thou know who made thee,\\n Gave thee life, and bid thee feed\\n By the stream and o\\'er the mead;\\n Gave thee clothing of delight,\\n Softest clothing, wolly, bright;\\n Gave thee such a tender voice,\\n Making all the vales rejoice?\\n   Little Lamb, who made thee?\\n   Dost thou know who made thee?\\n \\n   Little Lamb, I\\'ll tell thee;\\n   Little Lamb, I\\'ll tell thee:\\n He is called by thy name,\\n For He calls Himself a Lamb\\n He is meek, and He is mild,\\n He became a little child.\\n I a child, and thou a lamb,\\n We are called by His name.\\n   Little Lamb, God bless thee!\\n   Little Lamb, God bless thee!\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE BLACK BOY\\n \\n My mother bore me in the southern wild,\\n   And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!\\n White as an angel is the English child,\\n   But I am black, as if bereaved of light.\\n \\n My mother taught me underneath a tree,\\n   And, sitting down before the heat of day,\\n She took me on her lap and kissed me,\\n   And, pointed to the east, began to say:\\n \\n \"Look on the rising sun: there God does live,\\n   And gives His light, and gives His heat away,\\n And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive\\n   Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.\\n \\n \"And we are put on earth a little space,\\n   That we may learn to bear the beams of love\\n And these black bodies and this sunburnt face\\n   Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.\\n \\n \"For when our souls have learn\\'d the heat to bear,\\n   The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,\\n Saying, \\'Come out from the grove, my love and care\\n   And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice\\',\"\\n \\n Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;\\n And thus I say to little English boy.\\n When I from black and he from white cloud free,\\n And round the tent of God like lambs we joy\\n \\n I\\'ll shade him from the heat till he can bear\\n To lean in joy upon our Father\\'s knee;\\n And then I\\'ll stand and stroke his silver hair,\\n And be like him, and he will then love me.\\n \\n \\n THE BLOSSOM\\n \\n Merry, merry sparrow!\\n Under leaves so green\\n A happy blossom \\n Sees you, swift as arrow,\\n Seek your cradle narrow,\\n Near my bosom.\\n Pretty, pretty robin!\\n Under leaves so green\\n A happy blossom\\n Hears you sobbing, sobbing,\\n Pretty, pretty robin,\\n Near my bosom.\\n \\n\\n THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER\\n \\n When my mother died I was very young,\\n And my father sold me while yet my tongue\\n Could scarcely cry \"Weep! weep! weep! weep!\"\\n So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.\\n \\n There\\'s little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,\\n That curled like a lamb\\'s back, was shaved; so I said,\\n \"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head\\'s bare,\\n You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\"\\n \\n And so he was quiet, and that very night,\\n As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight! --\\n That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,\\n Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.\\n \\n And by came an angel, who had a bright key,\\n And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;\\n Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,\\n And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.\\n \\n Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,\\n They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;\\n And the Angel told Tom, if he\\'d be a good boy,\\n He\\'d have God for his father, and never want joy.\\n \\n And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,\\n And got with our bags and our brushes to work.\\n Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:\\n So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE BOY LOST\\n \\n \"Father, father, where are you going?\\n   Oh do not walk so fast!\\n Speak, father, speak to you little boy,\\n   Or else I shall be lost.\"\\n \\n The night was dark, no father was there,\\n   The child was wet with dew;\\n The mire was deep, and the child did weep,\\n   And away the vapour flew.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE BOY FOUND\\n \\n The little boy lost in the lonely fen,\\n   Led by the wandering light,\\n Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,\\n   Appeared like his father, in white.\\n \\n He kissed the child, and by the hand led,\\n   And to his mother brought,\\n Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,\\n   The little boy weeping sought.\\n \\n \\n LAUGHING SONG\\n \\n When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,\\n And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;\\n When the air does laugh with our merry wit,\\n And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;\\n \\n when the meadows laugh with lively green,\\n And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,\\n When Mary and Susan and Emily\\n With their sweet round mouths sing \"Ha, ha he!\"\\n \\n When the painted birds laugh in the shade,\\n Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:\\n Come live, and be merry, and join with me,\\n To sing the sweet chorus of \"Ha, ha, he!\"\\n \\n \\n A  SONG\\n \\n Sweet dreams, form a shade\\n O\\'er my lovely infant\\'s head!\\n Sweet dreams of pleasant streams\\n By happy, silent, moony beams!\\n \\n Sweet Sleep, with soft down\\n Weave thy brows an infant crown\\n Sweet Sleep, angel mild,\\n Hover o\\'er my happy child!\\n \\n Sweet smiles, in the night\\n Hover over my delight!\\n Sweet smiles, mother\\'s smile,\\n All the livelong night beguile.\\n \\n Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,\\n Chase not slumber from thine eyes!\\n Sweet moan, sweeter smile,\\n All the dovelike moans beguile.\\n \\n Sleep, sleep, happy child!\\n All creation slept and smiled.\\n Sleep, sleep, happy sleep,\\n While o\\'er thee doth mother weep.\\n \\n Sweet babe, in thy face\\n Holy image I can trace;\\n Sweet babe, once like thee\\n Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:\\n \\n Wept for me, for thee, for all,\\n When He was an infant small.\\n Thou His image ever see,\\n Heavenly face that smiles on thee!\\n \\n Smiles on thee, on me, on all,\\n Who became an infant small;\\n Infant smiles are his own smiles;\\n Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.\\n \\n \\n DIVINE IMAGE\\n \\n To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,\\n   All pray in their distress,\\n And to these virtues of delight\\n   Return their thankfulness.\\n \\n For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,\\n   Is God our Father dear;\\n And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,\\n   Is man, his child and care.\\n \\n For Mercy has a human heart\\n   Pity, a human face;\\n And Love, the human form divine;\\n   And Peace, the human dress.\\n \\n Then every man, of every clime,\\n   That prays in his distress,\\n Prays to the human form divine:\\n   Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.\\n \\n And all must love the human form,\\n   In heathen, Turk, or Jew.\\n Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,\\n   There God is dwelling too.\\n \\n \\n HOLY THURSDAY\\n \\n \\'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,\\n Came children walking two and two, in read, and blue, and green:\\n Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,\\n Till into the high dome of Paul\\'s they like Thames waters flow.\\n \\n Oh what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!\\n Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.\\n The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,\\n Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.\\n \\n Now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song,\\n Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:\\n Beneath them sit the aged man, wise guardians of the poor.\\n Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.\\n \\n \\n NIGHT\\n \\n The sun descending in the west,\\n The evening star does shine;\\n The birds are silent in their nest,\\n And I must seek for mine.\\n   The moon, like a flower\\n   In heaven\\'s high bower,\\n   With silent delight,\\n   Sits and smiles on the night.\\n \\n Farewell, green fields and happy grove,\\n Where flocks have ta\\'en delight.\\n Where lambs have nibbled, silent move\\n The feet of angels bright;\\n   Unseen they pour blessing,\\n   And joy without ceasing,\\n   On each bud and blossom,\\n   And each sleeping bosom.\\n \\n They look in every thoughtless nest\\n Where birds are covered warm;\\n They visit caves of every beast,\\n To keep them all from harm:\\n   If they see any weeping\\n   That should have been sleeping,\\n   They pour sleep on their head,\\n   And sit down by their bed.\\n \\n When wolves and tigers howl for prey,\\n They pitying stand and weep;\\n Seeking to drive their thirst away,\\n And keep them from the sheep.\\n   But, if they rush dreadful,\\n   The angels, most heedful,\\n   Receive each mild spirit,\\n   New worlds to inherit.\\n \\n \\n And there the lion\\'s ruddy eyes\\n Shall flow with tears of gold:\\n And pitying the tender cries,\\n And walking round the fold:\\n   Saying: \"Wrath by His meekness,\\n   And, by His health, sickness,\\n   Are driven away\\n   From our immortal day.\\n \\n \"And now beside thee, bleating lamb,\\n I can lie down and sleep,\\n Or think on Him who bore thy name,\\n Graze after thee, and weep.\\n   For, washed in life\\'s river,\\n   My bright mane for ever\\n   Shall shine like the gold,\\n   As I guard o\\'er the fold.\"\\n \\n \\n SPRING\\n \\n      Sound the flute!\\n      Now it\\'s mute!\\n      Bird\\'s delight,\\n      Day and night,\\n      Nightingale,\\n      In the dale,\\n      Lark in sky,--\\n      Merrily,\\n Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.\\n \\n      Little boy,\\n      Full of joy;\\n      Little girl,\\n      Sweet and small;\\n      Cock does crow,\\n      So do you;\\n      Merry voice,\\n      Infant noise;\\n Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.\\n \\n      Little lamb,\\n      Here I am;\\n      Come and lick\\n      My white neck;\\n      Let me pull\\n      Your soft wool;\\n      Let me kiss\\n      Your soft face;\\n Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.\\n \\n \\n NURSE\\'S SONG\\n \\n When the voices of children are heard on the green,\\n   And laughing is heard on the hill,\\n My heart is at rest within my breast,\\n   And everything else is still.\\n \"Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,\\n   And the dews of night arise;\\n Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,\\n   Till the morning appears in the skies.\"\\n \\n \"No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,\\n   And we cannot go to sleep;\\n Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,\\n   And the hills are all covered with sheep.\"\\n \"Well, well, go and play till the light fades away,\\n   And then go home to bed.\"\\n The little ones leaped, and shouted, and laughed,\\n   And all the hills echoed.\\n \\n \\n INFANT JOY\\n \\n \"I have no name;\\n I am but two days old.\"\\n What shall I call thee?\\n \"I happy am,\\n Joy is my name.\"\\n Sweet joy befall thee!\\n \\n Pretty joy!\\n Sweet joy, but two days old.\\n Sweet Joy I call thee:\\n Thou dost smile,\\n I sing the while;\\n Sweet joy befall thee!\\n \\n \\n A DREAM\\n \\n Once a dream did weave a shade\\n O\\'er my angel-guarded bed,\\n That an emmet lost its way\\n Where on grass methought I lay.\\n \\n Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,\\n Dark, benighted, travel-worn,\\n Over many a tangle spray,\\n All heart-broke, I heard her say:\\n \\n \"Oh my children! do they cry,\\n Do they hear their father sigh?\\n Now they look abroad to see,\\n Now return and weep for me.\"\\n \\n Pitying, I dropped a tear:\\n But I saw a glow-worm near,\\n Who replied, \"What wailing wight\\n Calls the watchman of the night?\\n \\n \"I am set to light the ground,\\n While the beetle goes his round:\\n Follow now the beetle\\'s hum;\\n Little wanderer, hie thee home!\"\\n \\n \\n ON ANOTHER\\'S SORROW\\n \\n Can I see another\\'s woe,\\n And not be in sorrow too?\\n Can I see another\\'s grief,\\n And not seek for kind relief?\\n \\n Can I see a falling tear,\\n And not feel my sorrow\\'s share?\\n Can a father see his child\\n Weep, nor be with sorrow filled?\\n \\n Can a mother sit and hear\\n An infant groan, an infant fear?\\n No, no!  never can it be!\\n Never, never can it be!\\n \\n And can He who smiles on all\\n Hear the wren with sorrows small,\\n Hear the small bird\\'s grief and care,\\n Hear the woes that infants bear --\\n \\n And not sit beside the next,\\n Pouring pity in their breast,\\n And not sit the cradle near,\\n Weeping tear on infant\\'s tear?\\n \\n And not sit both night and day,\\n Wiping all our tears away?\\n Oh no! never can it be!\\n Never, never can it be!\\n \\n He doth give his joy to all:\\n He becomes an infant small,\\n He becomes a man of woe,\\n He doth feel the sorrow too.\\n \\n Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,\\n And thy Maker is not by:\\n Think not thou canst weep a tear,\\n And thy Maker is not year.\\n \\n Oh He gives to us his joy,\\n That our grief He may destroy:\\n Till our grief is fled an gone\\n He doth sit by us and moan.\\n \\n \\n SONGS OF EXPERIENCE\\n \\n \\n INTRODUCTION\\n \\n Hear the voice of the Bard,\\n Who present, past, and future, sees;\\n Whose ears have heard\\n The Holy Word\\n That walked among the ancient tree;\\n \\n Calling the lapsed soul,\\n And weeping in the evening dew;\\n That might control\\n The starry pole,\\n And fallen, fallen light renew!\\n \\n \"O Earth, O Earth, return!\\n Arise from out the dewy grass!\\n Night is worn,\\n And the morn\\n Rises from the slumbrous mass.\\n \\n \"Turn away no more;\\n Why wilt thou turn away?\\n The starry floor,\\n The watery shore,\\n Are given thee till the break of day.\"\\n \\n \\n EARTH\\'S ANSWER\\n \\n Earth raised up her head\\n From the darkness dread and drear,\\n Her light fled,\\n Stony, dread,\\n And her locks covered with grey despair.\\n \\n \"Prisoned on watery shore,\\n Starry jealousy does keep my den\\n Cold and hoar;\\n Weeping o\\'re,\\n I hear the father of the ancient men.\\n \\n \"Selfish father of men!\\n Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!\\n Can delight,\\n Chained in night,\\n The virgins of youth and morning bear?\\n \\n \\n \"Does spring hide its joy,\\n When buds and blossoms grow?\\n Does the sower \\n Sow by night,\\n Or the plowman in darkness plough?\\n \\n \"Break this heavy chain,\\n That does freeze my bones around!\\n Selfish, vain,\\n Eternal bane,\\n That free love with bondage bound.\"\\n \\n \\n THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE\\n \\n \"Love seeketh not itself to please,\\n   Nor for itself hath any care,\\n But for another gives it ease,\\n   And builds a heaven in hell\\'s despair.\"\\n \\n So sang a little clod of clay,\\n   Trodden with the cattle\\'s feet,\\n But a pebble of the brook\\n   Warbled out these metres meet:\\n \\n \"Love seeketh only Self to please,\\n   To bind another to its delight,\\n Joys in another\\'s loss of ease,\\n   And builds a hell in heaven\\'s despite.\"\\n \\n \\n HOLY THURSDAY\\n \\n Is this a holy thing to see\\n   In a rich and fruitful land, --\\n Babes reduced to misery,\\n   Fed with cold and usurous hand?\\n \\n Is that trembling cry a song?\\n   Can it be a song of joy?\\n And so many children poor?\\n   It is a land of poverty!\\n \\n And their son does never shine,\\n   And their fields are bleak and bare,\\n And their ways are filled with thorns:\\n   It is eternal winter there.\\n \\n For where\\'er the sun does shine,\\n   And where\\'er the rain does fall,\\n Babes should never hunger there,\\n   Nor poverty the mind appall.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE GIRL LOST\\n \\n In futurity\\n I prophetic see\\n That the earth from sleep\\n (Grave the sentence deep)\\n \\n Shall arise, and seek\\n for her Maker meek;\\n And the desert wild\\n Become a garden mild.\\n \\n In the southern clime,\\n Where the summer\\'s prime\\n Never fades away,\\n Lovely Lyca lay.\\n \\n Seven summers old\\n Lovely Lyca told.\\n She had wandered long,\\n Hearing wild birds\\' song.\\n \\n \"Sweet sleep, come to me\\n Underneath this tree;\\n Do father, mother, weep?\\n Where can Lyca sleep?\\n \\n \"Lost in desert wild\\n Is your little child.\\n How can Lyca sleep\\n If her mother weep?\\n \\n \"If her heart does ache,\\n Then let Lyca wake;\\n If my mother sleep,\\n Lyca shall not weep.\\n \\n \"Frowning, frowning night,\\n O\\'er this desert bright\\n Let thy moon arise,\\n While I close my eyes.\"\\n \\n Sleeping Lyca lay\\n While the beasts of prey,\\n Come from caverns deep,\\n Viewed the maid asleep.\\n \\n The kingly lion stood,\\n And the virgin viewed:\\n Then he gambolled round\\n O\\'er the hallowed ground.\\n \\n Leopards, tigers, play\\n Round her as she lay;\\n While the lion old\\n Bowed his mane of gold,\\n \\n And her breast did lick\\n And upon her neck,\\n From his eyes of flame,\\n Ruby tears there came;\\n \\n While the lioness\\n Loosed her slender dress,\\n And naked they conveyed\\n To caves the sleeping maid.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND\\n \\n All the night in woe\\n Lyca\\'s parents go\\n Over valleys deep,\\n While the deserts weep.\\n \\n Tired and woe-begone,\\n Hoarse with making moan,\\n Arm in arm, seven days\\n They traced the desert ways.\\n \\n Seven nights they sleep\\n Among shadows deep,\\n And dream they see their child\\n Starved in desert wild.\\n \\n Pale through pathless ways\\n The fancied image strays,\\n Famished, weeping, weak,\\n With hollow piteous shriek.\\n \\n Rising from unrest,\\n The trembling woman presse\\n With feet of weary woe;\\n She could no further go.\\n \\n In his arms he bore\\n Her, armed with sorrow sore;\\n Till before their way\\n A couching lion lay.\\n \\n Turning back was vain:\\n Soon his heavy mane\\n Bore them to the ground,\\n Then he stalked around,\\n \\n Smelling to his prey;\\n But their fears allay\\n When he licks their hands,\\n And silent by them stands.\\n \\n They look upon his eyes,\\n Filled with deep surprise;\\n And wondering behold\\n A spirit armed in gold.\\n \\n On his head a crown,\\n On his shoulders down\\n Flowed his golden hair.\\n Gone was all their care.\\n \\n \"Follow me,\" he said;\\n \"Weep not for the maid;\\n In my palace deep,\\n Lyca lies asleep.\"\\n \\n Then they followed\\n Where the vision led,\\n And saw their sleeping child\\n Among tigers wild.\\n \\n To this day they dwell\\n In a lonely dell,\\n Nor fear the wolvish howl\\n Nor the lion\\'s growl.\\n \\n \\n THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER\\n \\n A little black thing in the snow,\\n Crying \"weep! weep!\" in notes of woe!\\n \"Where are thy father and mother? Say!\"--\\n \"They are both gone up to the church to pray.\\n \\n \"Because I was happy upon the heath,\\n And smiled among the winter\\'s snow,\\n They clothed me in the clothes of death,\\n And taught me to sing the notes of woe.\\n \\n \"And because I am happy and dance and sing,\\n They think they have done me no injury,\\n And are gone to praise God and his priest and king,\\n Who make up a heaven of our misery.\"\\n \\n \\n NURSE\\'S SONG\\n \\n When voices of children are heard on the green,\\n And whisperings are in the dale,\\n The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,\\n My face turns green and pale.\\n \\n Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,\\n And the dews of night arise;\\n Your spring and your day are wasted in play,\\n And your winter and night in disguise.\\n \\n \\n THE SICK ROSE\\n \\n O rose, thou art sick!\\n   The invisible worm,\\n That flies in the night,\\n   In the howling storm,\\n \\n Has found out thy bed\\n   Of crimson joy,\\n And his dark secret love\\n   Does thy life destroy.\\n \\n \\n THE FLY\\n \\n Little Fly,\\n Thy summer\\'s play\\n My thoughtless hand\\n Has brushed away.\\n \\n Am not I\\n A fly like thee?\\n Or art not thou\\n A man like me?\\n \\n For I dance\\n And drink, and sing,\\n Till some blind hand\\n Shall brush my wing.\\n \\n If thought is life\\n And strength and breath\\n And the want \\n Of thought is death;\\n \\n Then am I\\n A happy fly,\\n If I live,\\n Or if I die.\\n \\n \\n THE ANGEL\\n \\n I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?\\n And that I was a maiden Queen\\n Guarded by an Angel mild:\\n Witless woe was ne\\'er beguiled!\\n \\n And I wept both night and day,\\n And he wiped my tears away;\\n And I wept both day and night,\\n And hid from him my heart\\'s delight.\\n \\n So he took his wings, and fled;\\n Then the morn blushed rosy red.\\n I dried my tears, and armed my fears\\n With ten-thousand shields and spears.\\n \\n Soon my Angel came again;\\n I was armed, he came in vain;\\n For the time of youth was fled,\\n And grey hairs were on my head.\\n \\n \\n THE TIGER\\n \\n Tiger, tiger, burning bright\\n In the forest of the night,\\n What immortal hand or eye\\n Could Frame thy fearful symmetry?\\n \\n In what distant deeps or skies\\n Burnt the fire of thine eyes?\\n On what wings dare he aspire?\\n What the hand dare seize the fire?\\n \\n And what shoulder and what art\\n Could twist the sinews of thy heart?\\n And, when thy heart began to beat,\\n What dread hand and what dread feet?\\n \\n What the hammer?  what the chain?\\n In what furnace was thy brain?\\n What the anvil? what dread grasp\\n Dare its deadly terrors clasp?\\n \\n When the stars threw down their spears,\\n And watered heaven with their tears,\\n Did he smile his work to see?\\n Did he who made the lamb make thee?\\n \\n Tiger, tiger, burning bright\\n In the forests of the night,\\n What immortal hand or eye\\n Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?\\n \\n \\n MY PRETTY ROSE TREE\\n \\n A flower was offered to me,\\n   Such a flower as May never bore;\\n But I said \"I\\'ve a pretty rose tree,\"\\n   And I passed the sweet flower o\\'er.\\n \\n Then I went to my pretty rose tree,\\n   To tend her by day and by night;\\n But my rose turned away with jealousy,\\n   And her thorns were my only delight.\\n \\n \\n AH SUNFLOWER\\n \\n Ah Sunflower, weary of time,\\n   Who countest the steps of the sun;\\n Seeking after that sweet golden clime\\n   Where the traveller\\'s journey is done;\\n \\n Where the Youth pined away with desire,\\n   And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,\\n Arise from their graves, and aspire\\n   Where my Sunflower wishes to go!\\n \\n \\n THE LILY\\n \\n The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,\\n The humble sheep a threat\\'ning horn:\\n While the Lily white shall in love delight,\\n Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.\\n \\n \\n THE GARDEN OF LOVE\\n \\n I laid me down upon a bank,\\n   Where Love lay sleeping;\\n I heard among the rushes dank\\n   Weeping, weeping.\\n \\n Then I went to the heath and the wild,\\n   To the thistles and thorns of the waste;\\n And they told me how they were beguiled,\\n   Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.\\n \\n I went to the Garden of Love,\\n   And saw what I never had seen;\\n A Chapel was built in the midst,\\n   Where I used to play on the green.\\n \\n And the gates of this Chapel were shut\\n   And \"Thou shalt not,\" writ over the door;\\n So I turned to the Garden of Love\\n   That so many sweet flowers bore.\\n \\n And I saw it was filled with graves,\\n   And tombstones where flowers should be;\\n And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,\\n   And binding with briars my joys and desires.\\n \\n \\n THE LITTLE VAGABOND\\n \\n Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold;\\n But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm.\\n Besides, I can tell where I am used well;\\n The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell.\\n \\n But, if at the Church they would give us some ale,\\n And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,\\n We\\'d sing and we\\'d pray all the livelong day,\\n Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray.\\n \\n Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing,\\n And we\\'d be as happy as birds in the spring;\\n And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,\\n Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.\\n \\n And God, like a father, rejoicing to see\\n His children as pleasant and happy as he,\\n Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,\\n But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.\\n \\n \\n LONDON\\n \\n I wandered through each chartered street,\\n   Near where the chartered Thames does flow,\\n A mark in every face I meet,\\n   Marks of weakness, marks of woe.\\n \\n In every cry of every man,\\n   In every infant\\'s cry of fear,\\n In every voice, in every ban,\\n   The mind-forged manacles I hear:\\n \\n How the chimney-sweeper\\'s cry\\n   Every blackening church appals,\\n And the hapless soldier\\'s sigh\\n   Runs in blood down palace-walls.\\n \\n But most, through midnight streets I hear\\n   How the youthful harlot\\'s curse\\n Blasts the new-born infant\\'s tear,\\n   And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.\\n \\n \\n THE HUMAN ABSTRACT\\n \\n Pity would be no more\\n If we did not make somebody poor,\\n And Mercy no more could be\\n If all were as happy as we.\\n \\n And mutual fear brings Peace,\\n Till the selfish loves increase\\n Then Cruelty knits a snare,\\n And spreads his baits with care.\\n \\n He sits down with his holy fears,\\n And waters the ground with tears;\\n Then Humility takes its root\\n Underneath his foot.\\n \\n Soon spreads the dismal shade\\n Of Mystery over his head,\\n And the caterpillar and fly\\n Feed on the Mystery.\\n \\n And it bears the fruit of Deceit,\\n Ruddy and sweet to eat,\\n And the raven his nest has made\\n In its thickest shade.\\n \\n The gods of the earth and sea\\n Sought through nature to find this tree,\\n But their search was all in vain:\\n There grows one in the human Brain.\\n \\n \\n INFANT SORROW\\n \\n My mother groaned, my father wept:\\n Into the dangerous world I leapt,\\n Helpless, naked, piping loud,\\n Like a fiend hid in a cloud.\\n \\n Struggling in my father\\'s hands,\\n Striving against my swaddling-bands,\\n Bound and weary, I thought best\\n To sulk upon my mother\\'s breast.\\n \\n \\n A POISON TREE\\n \\n I was angry with my friend:\\n I told my wrath, my wrath did end.\\n I was angry with my foe:\\n I told it not, my wrath did grow.\\n \\n And I watered it in fears\\n Night and morning with my tears,\\n And I sunned it with smiles\\n And with soft deceitful wiles.\\n \\n And it grew both day and night,\\n Till it bore an apple bright,\\n And my foe beheld it shine,\\n and he knew that it was mine, --\\n \\n And into my garden stole\\n When the night had veiled the pole;\\n In the morning, glad, I see\\n My foe outstretched beneath the tree.\\n \\n \\n A LITTLE BOY LOST\\n \\n \"Nought loves another as itself,\\n   Nor venerates another so,\\n Nor is it possible to thought\\n   A greater than itself to know.\\n \\n \"And, father, how can I love you \\n   Or any of my brothers more?\\n I love you like the little bird\\n   That picks up crumbs around the door.\"\\n \\n The Priest sat by and heard the child;\\n   In trembling zeal he seized his hair,\\n He led him by his little coat,\\n   And all admired the priestly care. \\n \\n And standing on the altar high,\\n   \"Lo, what a fiend is here! said he:\\n \"One who sets reason up for judge\\n   Of our most holy mystery.\"\\n \\n The weeping child could not be heard,\\n   The weeping parents wept in vain:\\n They stripped him to his little shirt,\\n   And bound him in an iron chain,\\n \\n And burned him in a holy place\\n   Where many had been burned before;\\n The weeping parents wept in vain.\\n   Are such thing done on Albion\\'s shore?\\n \\n \\n A LITTLE GIRL LOST\\n \\n Children of the future age,\\n Reading this indignant page,\\n Know that in a former time\\n Love, sweet love, was thought a crime.\\n \\n In the age of gold,\\n Free from winter\\'s cold,\\n Youth and maiden bright,\\n To the holy light,\\n Naked in the sunny beams delight.\\n \\n Once a youthful pair,\\n Filled with softest care,\\n Met in garden bright\\n Where the holy light\\n Had just removed the curtains of the night.\\n \\n Then, in rising day,\\n On the grass they play;\\n Parents were afar,\\n Strangers came not near,\\n And the maiden soon forgot her fear.\\n \\n Tired with kisses sweet,\\n They agree to meet\\n When the silent sleep\\n Waves o\\'er heaven\\'s deep,\\n And the weary tired wanderers weep.\\n \\n To her father white\\n Came the maiden bright;\\n But his loving look,\\n Like the holy book\\n All her tender limbs with terror shook.\\n \\n \"Ona, pale and weak,\\n To thy father speak!\\n Oh the trembling fear!\\n Oh the dismal care\\n That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!\"\\n \\n \\n THE SCHOOLBOY\\n \\n I love to rise on a summer morn, \\n   When birds are singing on every tree;\\n The distant huntsman winds his horn,\\n   And the skylark sings with me:\\n   Oh what sweet company!\\n \\n But to go to school in a summer morn, --\\n   Oh it drives all joy away!\\n Under a cruel eye outworn,\\n   The little ones spend the day\\n   In sighing and dismay.\\n \\n Ah then at times I drooping sit,\\n   And spend many an anxious hour;\\n Nor in my book can I take delight,\\n   Nor sit in learning\\'s bower,\\n   Worn through with the dreary shower.\\n \\n How can the bird that is born for joy\\n   Sit in a cage and sing?\\n How can a child, when fears annoy,\\n   But droop his tender wing,\\n   And forget his youthful spring?\\n \\n Oh father and mother, if buds are nipped,\\n   And blossoms blown away;\\n And if the tender plants are stripped\\n   Of their joy in the springing day,\\n   By sorrow and care\\'s dismay, --\\n \\n How shall the summer arise in joy,\\n   Or the summer fruits appear?\\n Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,\\n   Or bless the mellowing year,\\n   When the blasts of winter appear?\\n \\n \\n TO TERZAH\\n \\n Whate\\'er is born of mortal birth\\n Must be consumed with the earth,\\n To rise from generation free:\\n Then what have I to do with thee?\\n The sexes sprang from shame and pride,\\n Blown in the morn, in evening died;\\n But mercy changed death into sleep;\\n The sexes rose to work and weep.\\n \\n Thou, mother of my mortal part,\\n With cruelty didst mould my heart,\\n And with false self-deceiving tears\\n Didst bind my nostrils, eyes, and ears,\\n \\n Didst close my tongue in senseless clay,\\n And me to mortal life betray.\\n The death of Jesus set me free:\\n Then what have I to do with thee?\\n \\n \\n THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD\\n \\n Youth of delight!  come hither\\n And see the opening morn,\\n Image of Truth new-born.\\n Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason,\\n Dark disputes and artful teazing.\\n Folly is an endless maze;\\n Tangled roots perplex her ways;\\n How many have fallen there!\\n They stumble all night over bones of the dead;\\n And feel -- they know not what but care;\\n And wish to lead others, when they should be led.\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\n A DIVINE IMAGE\\n \\n Cruelty has a human heart,\\n   And Jealousy a human face;\\n Terror the human form divine,\\n   And Secresy the human dress.\\n \\n The human dress is forged iron,\\n   The human form a fiery forge,\\n The human face a furnace sealed,\\n   The human heart its hungry gorge.\\n \\n NOTE:  Though written and engraved by

Blake. 1780\\n\\n\\nTHEL\\n\\nI\\n\\nThe daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,\\nAll but the youngest: she in paleness sought the secret air.\\nTo fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day:\\nDown by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard;\\nAnd thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.\\n\\nO life of this our spring!  why fades the lotus of the water?\\nWhy fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall.\\nAh! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting cloud,\\nLike a reflection in a glass: like shadows in the water\\nLike dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infants face.\\nLike the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air:\\nAh! gentle may I lay me down and gentle rest my head.\\nAnd gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice \\nOf him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.\\n\\nThe Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass\\nAnswerd the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed,\\nAnd I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales:\\nSo weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head\\nYet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all\\nWalks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads his hand\\nSaying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lily flower.\\nThou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks:\\nFor thou shall be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna:\\nTill summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs\\nTo flourish in eternal vales: they why should Thel complain.\\nWhy should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.\\n\\nShe ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.\\n\\nThel answerd, O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley.\\nGiving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o\\'er tired\\nThe breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells the milky garments\\nHe crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face,\\nWiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.\\nThy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume.\\nWhich thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs\\nRevives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed.\\nBut Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun:\\nI vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place.\\n\\nQueen of the vales the Lily answered, ask the tender cloud,\\nAnd it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky.\\nAnd why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.\\nDescend O little cloud & hover before the eyes of Thel.\\n\\nThe Cloud descended and the Lily bowd her modest head:\\nAnd went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.\\n\\n\\nII.\\n\\nO little Cloud the virgin said, I charge thee to tell me\\nWhy thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away:\\nThen we shall seek thee but not find: ah Thel is like to thee.\\nI pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.\\n\\nThe Cloud then shewd his golden head & his bright form emerg\\'d.\\nHovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.\\n\\nO virgin know\\'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs\\nWhere Luvah doth renew his horses: lookst thou on my youth.\\nAnd fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.\\nNothing remains; O maid I tell thee, when I pass away.\\nIt is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy:\\nUnseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers:\\nAnd court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent\\nThe weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun.\\nTill we arise link\\'d in a golden band and never part:\\nBut walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers.\\n\\nDost thou O little cloud?  I fear that I am not like thee:\\nFor I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers:\\nBut I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds,\\nBut I feed not the warbling birds, they fly and seek their food:\\nBut Thel delights in these no more because I fade away\\nAnd all shall say, without a use this shining women liv\\'d,\\nOr did she only live to be at death the food of worms.\\n\\nThe Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus.\\n\\nThen if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,\\nHow great thy use, how great thy blessing, every thing that lives.\\nLives not alone nor or itself: fear not and I will call,\\nThe weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice.\\nCome forth worm and the silent valley, to thy pensive queen.\\n\\nThe helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf,\\nAnd the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.\\n\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nThen Thel astonish\\'d view\\'d the Worm upon its dewy bed.\\n\\nArt thou a Worm?  image of weakness.  art thou but a Worm?\\nI see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf;\\nAh weep not little voice, thou can\\'st not speak, but thou can\\'st weep:\\nIs this a Worm?  I see they lay helpless & naked: weeping\\nAnd none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.\\n\\nThe Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais\\'d her pitying head:\\nShe bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald\\nIn milky fondness, then on Thel she fix\\'d her humble eyes\\n\\nO beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,\\nThou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed:\\nMy bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,\\n\\nBut he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head\\nAnd kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.\\nAnd says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee\\nAnd I have given thee a crown that none can take away.\\nBut how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know\\nI ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.\\n\\nThe daughter of beauty wip\\'d her pitying tears with her white veil,\\nAnd said, Alas!  I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:\\nThat God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot\\nThat wilful bruis\\'d its helpless form: but that he cherish\\'d it\\nWith milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,\\nAnd I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.\\nAnd lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.\\n\\nQueen of the vales, the matron Clay answered: I heard thy sighs.\\nAnd all thy moans flew o\\'er my roof, but I have call\\'d them down:\\nWilt thou O Queen enter my house, tis given thee to enter,\\nAnd to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet.\\n\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nThe eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:\\nThel enter\\'d in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;\\nShe saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots\\nOf every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:\\nA land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.\\n\\nShe wandered in the land of clouds thro\\' valleys dark, listning\\nDolors & lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave\\nShe stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,\\nTill to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down.\\nAnd heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.\\n\\nWhy cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?\\nOr the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile!\\nWhy are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,\\nWhere a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!\\nOr an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold!\\n\\nWhy a Tongue impress\\'d with honey from every wind?\\nWhy an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?\\nWhy a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright\\nWhy a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?\\nWhy a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?\\n\\nThe Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek,\\nFled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har\\n\\n\\n'"
